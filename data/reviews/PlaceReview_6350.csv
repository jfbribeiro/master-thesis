82859,3241449,5,Tucha,31/08/2023,"It is not a caravan park. It is a space where you can park and there is no prohibition sign. We spent a day here and stayed overnight. Very peaceful. In front of the hotel, bus 16 passes directly to the center of S. Sebastian every 30 minutes. €1.85 each trip. It is regrettable that there are no paid motorhome parks in S. Sebastian. Wonderful city but not caravan frendly."
82859,3070782,4,benjaminestable,03/08/2023,"Nice location on a dirt parking lot, the places are a little sloping but the site is good, on the GR with a great view and hiking trails and not far from the city center on foot and from a bus stop, ideal <7m"
82859,3055033,4,TomiBacon,01/08/2023,A quiet place among greenery
82859,3037675,3,Pepperli,29/07/2023,"Here we stood one night. Unfortunately, people still came at night who wanted to use the parking space, and not exactly quietly. The garbage disposal also emptied the bottle container at night. But otherwise it worked. The amusement park above offers unique views of San Sebastian. Be sure to stay until sunset."
82859,3026438,4,ImaGIN22,26/07/2023,"Nice spot for camper vans: around 8 places. Quite small, the place quickly becomes friendly. In the shade. Right next to the road, but from the 22hoo everything gets quieter. Near hotel, hiking trail, and superb view. No amenities on site. Perfect for a night without the need to cook or anything."
82859,3016756,5,jeanden,25/07/2023,great. quiet.. great view at 20 meters. parking lot with 8 large spaces max. it is slightly sloping to put on hold and perfect night .. we immediately feel in the Basque country on waking. the ewes. view . the Basque hotel .. at the top.
82859,2691702,4,stessyrivalin85,23/04/2023,"Parking near the city, possibility of a short hike with a great view. No convenience, relatively noisy with the road, not many level places."
82859,2603482,5,TimdelaT,09/03/2023,"All paid parking around the center and not here, there were more campers so it felt safe. The branch end down is quite okay and you can walk from two sides, so a nice circle around, if you take the less passable path you will reach a beautiful view of the bay after a few minutes!"
82859,2523224,4,kundalininomad,17/12/2022,"Free parking overlooking the city and the sea, can be noisy with cars, walkers and rubbish collection trucks, but it’s fine for an overnight stay…… 30 min walk down to the beach and old town……it is what it is, don’t expect paradise but I’ve stopped at worse spots……"
82859,2283667,3,sil_van,22/08/2022,"to sleep if you can't find another place. Passage of the Camino de Santiago, next to the hotel (they do not provide breakfast if you are not staying) Quiet night despite having the road stuck"
82859,2207688,2,HansElfi,10/08/2022,Only suitable as a day parking space. Way too loud at night. Busy activity and traffic noise from the street.
82859,2179996,5,celine35290,05/08/2022,Super nice little parking lot!! But very small. You can walk down to the beach in 10 min. There is a funicular and a playground a few meters away. Be careful if you continue the road you must necessarily enter the park and pay.
82859,2130834,5,Gian.luca,27/07/2022,"great spot, very quiet at night and during the day. we left the camper all day without worries. To visit the city you can go down a small road and in 10 minutes you are at the Hondarreta beach. Or bus 16 in front of the hotel. There is also a path that takes you to a cliff in 10 minutes."
82859,2077847,3,mariiietee,15/07/2022,"Without further ado, to spend one night and that's it. Quiet night but nothing special."
82859,2001422,4,Farlafinita,22/06/2022,Good place for 1 night
82859,1955468,5,albacano,07/06/2022,"Very good place, it is very quiet, I arrived after 10pm and got a place. you have the trash so you don't leave anything, if you come use it. We slept several vans. It's great and you don't have to worry about paying for the blue zone!"
82859,1747035,5,unbekannter,03/02/2022,"Small gravel parking lot next to the hotel parking lot. Quiet, a few hikers pass by. 30 minute walk down hill into town. There are dumpsters on the square."
82859,1734100,3,Montezelin,14/01/2022,"Great but not flat, too bad we would have stopped there for the night."
82859,1700340,4,victorm.94,29/11/2021,"Small parking, but with sea views and several garbage cans for recycling and everything"
82859,1595681,4,Vivi92,20/09/2021,Really top location and close to bus stop 16 which leads directly into the center. Near Mount Igueldo
82859,1493617,4,Bruno_P,21/08/2021,"Beautiful view of the city, a free spot without amenities but given the hassle in the city it was welcome when arriving at almost 6.30 p.m."
82859,1304567,2,viajeroslocos,07/07/2021,"Too far away of the beach and the city. Although we enjoyed the 30 min walk on the way down, later it was very exhausting to go uphill. During the night we were bothered by all the noisy trucks coming with 1-2 hours of intervals to collect the different trash bins. Also early in the morning trekkers are passing through the parking spot."
82859,1265488,3,Frost_Viking,20/06/2021,"Dwarf place, for 3-4 Ac at the most and if you have room, half an hour from the beach, yes, then it is time to go up and climb telita. You have a dirt road that starts from there that will lead to a viewpoint with beautiful views of San Sebastián. If you just want to spend the day without spending the night, it is best to pay the blue zone next to the beach and you are 5 minutes from the beach"
82859,1029493,3,MartaSampaio,06/09/2020,"I spent one night here, there was only another van. Maybe because it was a Saturday night, but there was a lot of people coming by night and in the morning a lot of noise too. 30 minutes walking to the beach. it's a bit far from everything as it's up hill. free parking."
82859,933462,3,tipexvan,05/08/2020,"A very good site for troubleshooting. No convenience, a bit of passage in the evening and in the morning but very useful for sleeping in such a touristy city."
82859,716244,5,AlexBabi,08/10/2019,"We were complicated to find parking in San Sebastian. We decided to depart a little from it and this reference place is a small area where you can make a good stop, or even spend the night, if the road is not very busy, I do not know."
82859,702434,4,Lootsssss,23/09/2019,"Finally a place rather easy to access, with room and rather quiet in St Sebastien. Rather Flat, shady, garbage cans nearby. We had shot so much in the city that we were happy to be here. Superb view. Just walk a bit to reach the beach (15/20 minutes) by a path. By bus from 12m KarasGo"
82859,650162,1,magnickfico,22/08/2019,Quiet next to the road and a hotel. Without services If you go down the grass path there are beautiful views of the ocean.
82859,537140,1,Estel31,03/07/2019,"To avoid in high season because noisy night at any time, passage and cars without stopping, the car park is constantly filled, garbage truck every hour (for what purpose ..?) ..Damage because the view is nice, 2/3 places van or camper, finally in the company of chickens and roosters nearby that ultimately prove the least annoying."
82859,508593,3,lolojerem,08/06/2019,A bit noisy at night (car dumper) and morning hiker but we had a good night. Descent to the beach by the hiking trail 15-20 min. free and practical spot.
82859,469042,2,3surlaroute,27/04/2019,Rather noisy but it helps for one night. Great view of San Sebastian. On foot take the small dirt road on the left to discover a splendid view of the bay and the cliffs. I would not leave my motorhome alone for the day.
82859,324838,2,sasegar,10/08/2018,"Acceptable place to spend the night. Without any service and something noisy, usual passage of vehicles and walkers. It is full of campers and campers, so it's better not to arrive too late."
82859,274850,3,Dje72,25/06/2018,Nice place seen on the city illuminated at night. 20 minutes from the beach on a hiker's path. Not too much noise at night in the direction of Mercury Hotel.
82863,2011481,5,Xavesp,26/06/2022,"Perfect and quiet place to spend the night, at the entrance there is a sign that says that it is allowed. It is 4 km from the start of the Mu route (walkways)."
82863,1900113,2,Madge21,19/05/2022,Next to main road so not private although not too many cars pass during the night. Much better at the other area in the village near the river. Handing for parking up to village for bakery or restaurant. No shade.
82863,1796103,5,furgonetiis,26/03/2022,quiet place near the village and the bakery

82863,1355516,3,Remolin,23/07/2021,"Quiet parking where you can spend the night, nearby there is a highly recommended restaurant where they serve a good menu."
82863,1257341,4,Kenny_castil,15/06/2021,We were in another one that is further down. Next to the pools. It is an area enabled for AC Very quiet. It has no services. The town has a beach bar next to the river (where you can bathe) and it has a commissary and a bakery.
82863,1184486,3,elsdos,03/05/2021,"We parked to eat, very comfortable since it is located next to the road to Balaguer."
82863,1053380,4,Perot,17/09/2020,"It is to be thanked. Almost inside the village. A normal car park, but with a very interesting note: Motorhomes can spend the night !!! Thank you very much town hall. Despite being on the side of the road it is not too noisy. Nearby a good restaurant for lunch, dinner or fork breakfast."
82863,278505,5,maripili77,01/07/2018,"Parking in the village. We have spent the night very quiet even being close to the road, in the morning more movement. Bar / restaurant nearby, bakery with good pastas and breads .. Near the river."
82867,3186468,2,Jr7231,20/08/2023,Shaded parking close to the city center. But extremely noisy due to its proximity to the main avenue and the fire station (we were there on the night of Saturday to Sunday).
82876,1135848,1,hasenteufel,07/02/2021,Just ugly. High-rise buildings without end.

82885,1825352,4,posvasereso,15/04/2022,"To go on the road is fine. We spent Holy Wednesday night in the middle of another camper and a trailer. Very quiet night, the only noise (logical) when the truck started to continue its route. We had breakfast in the restaurant and the waiters were a bit dry, like someone who deals with people passing through and if they don't come back, it doesn't matter."
82885,334107,3,Toniomorrosco,14/08/2018,Acceptable place to stop or even overnight. Without services
82907,422335,1,Heinz54,13/01/2019,This can only be achieved with a very off-road mobile home. The journey is not worthwhile. Except for a normal picnic area nothing is offered here.
82911,2914619,3,roadtripLV,02/07/2023,"Camping that does the trick for one night. Average sanitary facilities, toilet paper is outside the toilets, it's a concept... lots of noise and lots of mosquitoes, bring mosquito nets and mosquito repellents. I still give 3 stars because the campsite is directly on the beach, which is very nice!"
82911,2527351,3,familieHommes,24/12/2022,"Great campsite, neat shower, nice lady at reception. Unfortunately nothing to do for children. 1 playground at the restaurant, but our 4-year-old daughter was too small for that. Beach is forbidden for dogs, but camping guests are not addressed about this, so unfortunately a lot of turds on the beach"
82911,2461743,4,fanthi34,25/10/2022,Pleasant campsite during the week numerous and clean sanitary facilities restaurant very correct and good price
82911,2101277,2,MaudDoux,21/07/2022,"disappointing because not restful a lot of noise day and night. many people, children shouting, many dogs barking, signaled and as an answer: the Spanish dogs louder than the French.... oops! No regulation on the hours of night activities it seems? The cleanliness and the beach ok hence the 2 stars stayed 3 nights instead of 10 Too bad !!!!"
82911,2020134,5,mochibike,28/06/2022,"We were on the bridge in May and we were delighted with the site, you have the beach 1 minute away and the parking spaces were quite spacious. recommendable"
82911,1888403,3,Valli83,14/05/2022,"In fact, avoid weekends. Everyone knows each other and parties late into the night with barking dogs and screaming kids. Sanitary outdated and not very clean. Wifi and mobile data at a minimum."
82911,1877382,3,dodogun,08/05/2022,"Camping not very cozy but with a beautiful beach by the sea .. be careful a lot of permanent caravan then… the weekend is the fiesta .. barbecue, it smokes it sings it speaks loudly so it makes noise … we can like but that's not too cool"
82911,1468764,5,borjaymaria811,16/08/2021,"Good campsite, in a beautiful place, we will return for sure, very quiet midweek, the weekend is already a campsite like any other"
82911,1466427,3,Melones,16/08/2021,The campsite is very well on the beach the facilities are good the only thing that has terrible is the bar insulting attention bad service hot beer and expensive price
82911,1208170,4,Selvaprada,20/05/2021,"The front row a hit, right on the ocean. Great, clean sandy beach. Friendly welcome, clean sanitary facilities. V&E. Only, the guy in the shop could be a little friendlier…. In May 2 nights with a dog 56 euros, reasonable."

82924,3204388,2,HugoMiguel,23/08/2023,"Good park near the river beach, but unfortunately in August it becomes impossible for an AC to park there. Very funny beach, but when I was there almost no one could move there, as there was a huge crowd in and out of the water. car parking was down the road up to 1 km. AC Micas do Jaime gives 2 stars"
82924,2922985,2,beccyanddan,04/07/2023,"Heaving with tourists. Zero mobile phone coverage anywhere around so couldn’t stay, (vodaphone, meo & nos!)"
82924,2020079,5,van_142_,28/06/2022,"Good parking lot to access the beach. The spots are large enough but be careful because cars tend to park in the other side of the road, making it difficult to leave!"
82924,1837626,5,byexinha,19/04/2022,Parking place to go to the river beach which is quite pleasant.
82924,1406175,3,zigalpt,04/08/2021,"The village and the natural swimming pool are lovely. although the water is cold, there are all the facilities you need (changing rooms, cafe, bathroom, etc). During the day it's really hard to find a parking, especially during tourist season (and it's very steep and uneven)"
82924,626978,3,ruimartins,14/08/2019,Spectacular beach in the middle of nature. To park it is convenient to arrive at night because it is full during the day and there is a lot of confusion.
82977,2383176,1,rufach,18/09/2022,"VERY UNLEVELED place. A LOT. This app is called PARK4NIGHT to be able to park and sleep, and in such a sloping place I don't see fit to sleep there."
82977,2007245,3,Burgaillo,24/06/2022,"Let's see, the site is what it is, a parking lot for cars that are going to visit the cave. It is quite inclined, you can sleep, but come on, it is for what it is, to visit the caves and, if anything, to do a route, forget about sleeping"
82977,1813486,3,ourworldheritage,10/04/2022,"Parked to visit the cave. With our van of 6m we already had to take three places. Quite sloping, so I wouldn't recommend this for an overnight stay. Beautiful view. Cave visit recommended, the disadvantage is that the tour is only in Spanish."
82977,1797553,3,beloncete,27/03/2022,"Perfect for us, but if you measure more than 5'40 you will occupy two seats or part of the islands. There are no larger squares. We arrived at night and no one was there. Then it fills up, the caves are very visited."
82977,1406452,5,maikelWeisenberg,05/08/2021,"We have spent the night here very quiet. We even put the heat on. As they say, some unevenness but the site deserves it. Perfect for visiting the caves now in the morning."
82977,780982,3,thegatehouses,15/02/2020,"Parked for the day to see the caves. 
As people have said, slopping parking but good views of the town below. 
Caves were very good,  well worth the entry."
82977,496369,3,gepetto66,29/05/2019,While waiting to visit the caves we spend the night on this parking lot. Sloping our big holds just enough.a beautiful view of the village.Calme except some dogs that bark in the bottom of the valley.
82977,410676,4,bumblebussing,28/11/2018,"Great spot to park if you are visiting the caves.(which is very worthwhile... 3 euros  pp to see some of the most prehistoric cave art in the world) 
The ground is on a slope and if busy the car park might be quite tight to turn in. We were fine in LWB van.
 Great views and a nice 30 minute walk to the top of the hill with incredible 360 views. We didn't stay the night but I am sure you can."
82978,2356016,4,Sarahnoa,09/09/2022,"Were on 01.09. there. Very quiet pitch. we were alone We were probably there during the holidays, so no other people to be seen in the morning, except for a member of staff from the school or the gym."

82978,1845776,5,Kaesekuchen,22/04/2022,"A hike to Ermida starts one place further in S. Miguel. It's a circular route. We recommend. The map can be found at the church of S. Miguel. There are also a few parking spaces at the church itself, but only up to 5.40 meters in length."
82978,887657,4,meguils,21/07/2020,Quiet parking in July (because there is no school). Passed a night no problem.

82979,3099719,5,FannySalHer,08/08/2023,"We slept super quiet, with the smell of nature and wonderful views, there were more cars parked but we were alone to sleep. Difficult entrance for motorhomes. well leveled. Drinking water source about two minutes walk"
82979,2234575,4,carmenmone,14/08/2022,"A very quiet parking lot, with views and close to the historic center. When we went in the middle of August we were alone and without any problem. It has no services, but there is a fountain to fill water in the next street. Difficult access for motorhomes, since it is reached through somewhat narrow streets, but no problem for campers or small ACs."
82979,2222075,3,Marratxi,12/08/2022,"For motorhomes or campers of more than 6mts it is difficult to access. After a right turn on a narrow street, there is a steep ramp with loose gravel. Otherwise, very nice place and seems quiet"
82979,2201494,4,CokeCisternas,09/08/2022,"Very quiet place to spend the night. You sleep with a slight incline. We sleep one night during the week, it may be that on the weekend there is more movement and noise."
82979,2147027,4,erligothur,30/07/2022,The parking lot was empty when we arrived this morning. No difficulty of access by van. The water point is a fountain on the street that follows. We stayed for a few hours. Possible to spend the night there

82979,1997575,5,vancitan,21/06/2022,"One of the best places we have found in Galicia, we have come by van and we have spent a super quiet night, at night they light up the cathedral and there are beautiful views. The townspeople are incredibly friendly and the town is one of the most beautiful in Spain. This stop is highly recommended."
82979,1618739,4,yoyasa,30/09/2021,"Very nice and very quiet place, the AC has it more difficult to get there, the vans without problem, next to the town."
82979,1590460,3,Boltthrower,19/09/2021,"The site is very good, parking surrounded by greenery on the outskirts of town, we were in mid-September. We were unlucky because it was Friday and at 3:30 in the morning the bottle boys came and we had to go to the motorhome area of the town. If it weren't for that I would give it 5 stars. I guess there won't be that problem on weekdays ..."
82979,1485549,5,Carlester,20/08/2021,We have spent a very quiet night. The town is about to knock but you can't hear anything. Narrow streets but no problem for a small van.
82979,1440314,1,Miranda05,11/08/2021,For AC it is not worth the stress of trying to get there. Narrow streets with parked cars etc. The AC area is right next door and it's pretty cool.
82979,1321945,5,soanpre,13/07/2021,"We were the only parked van and we had a great, quiet night. You also take four steps and you are next to the historic center. We had dinner in the cathedral square at “Bodegón a catedral”, a recommended place if you like quality homemade and traditional food at a good price."
82979,841550,3,OlXt3873,29/06/2020,"Beautiful area on interlocking cobblestones, unlit close to the historic center. Difficult access and avoid for large motorhomes."
82979,629636,4,jpz,15/08/2019,"In fact the exit turn on the left passes alone, without maneuvering and at once."
82979,625287,4,jpz,13/08/2019,Superb parking. Empty: we spent the night at 2 CC. Only for small CC Maxi 7m. To leave the same road only to go (watch out for balconies) where turn left on the small square. Feasible in 2 or 3 times.
82979,501928,3,RoamingFree,02/06/2019,Super nice park and very quiet. The town is lovely and well worth the stop. No amenities but shops/restaurants within walking distance.

82991,3268191,5,Fleur1808,07/09/2023,A beautiful little park with barbecues and benches by the water. Quiet and with space. I recommand it ! Small shop and bakery in the village 20min walk
82991,3187816,4,demamidema,20/08/2023,toilets closed. Otherwise nice. Lots of space - all in the shade. Think many campers are overnight.

82991,3143129,5,RaulJorquera,14/08/2023,"Beautiful place, allows bathing in the swamp. It does not allow camping, but if you sleep in a vehicle or AC, the police passed by making rounds at night (9:00 p.m.) and everything was correct. There's even maintenance cleaning the place. The bathrooms are closed, but there are some outdoor sinks with water (not very clean). Picnic tables, barbecues and shade everywhere."
82991,3120292,4,slavenant2,11/08/2023,"Great place, great view of the lake. No problem of space and picnic table available. Only problem…dogs barked in the evening and in the morning."
82991,3097108,3,Muedra,07/08/2023,It is a very nice place but the squares are not flat and the vc 24h has been closed for so long that it has graffiti complaining about it. We did not spend the night since they told us that it was not possible and someone would come and we preferred to leave before looking for another good place.
82991,3084624,4,FernandoViader,05/08/2023,"The site as commented. The only thing to be aware of is that there is wildlife. Be careful with keeping the rubbish inside, it is not pleasant to listen to the wild boars at night hanging around the vehicle."
82991,3060130,5,PapaCho,01/08/2023,"super nice, even in low season. arrived around 7 p.m. when people were leaving so no problem with space. The large park allows children to play without problems. we haven't tried swimming, which doesn't really make you want to. on the other hand great area for fishing in the evening or in the morning."
82991,3024866,5,Moped22,26/07/2023,"A very nice place, right on the lake, wonderfully quiet. The police came by, looked for the right one and drove off again.

82991,3009449,5,Apablo1,23/07/2023,"A great place, with a beach next to the swamp. The only downside is that there are few flat sites."
82991,2957505,4,Guyonaarts,13/07/2023,"quiet place for a night. lovely forest for children to play, including playground for little ones. nice lawn. only drawback, you are very crooked everywhere.

82991,1892918,5,SaraRullo,15/05/2022,"Very quiet spot to spend the night. It has picnic areas with spectacular views of the reservoir and several barbecues. It also has a bathroom and laundry room, in our case, it has been open all night. It is highly recommended to go to the Legutio taverns, just 15 minutes away on foot, and pay a visit to the neighboring town of Urrunaga (approx. 1 hour on foot)."
82991,1834258,3,yanaick,18/04/2022,It's an open dumpster. We arrived at night and were shocked when we woke up. The toilets were closed. The police came by in the morning and said nothing. It's a shame because the site without a trash can would be magnificent. That's why we give 3 stars. The right side when arriving where cars cannot access it is very beautiful.
82991,1826101,4,Maike35782,16/04/2022,"A very nice place with many picnic benches and barbecue facilities right on the lake. At night you stand a bit crooked if you want to have a view of the lake. But you can also park a little further up. In the evening there were still a few people on site and had a barbecue, but it was still very quiet."
82991,1789786,5,Tierras_Insolitas,20/03/2022,"Good place to spend the day enjoying the swamp. We have spent a good night, very quiet. In the area above the car park (right at the entrance) there are about 3 level parking spaces (the following parking spaces are inclined)."

82991,1514802,3,ClaireRzmbd,26/08/2021,"The place seems at first glance idyllic, we were able to park the van on a flat area under the pines, therefore shaded, to enjoy the sunset over the lake. However, a lot of not very reassuring passage during the night. Think of the earplug."
82991,1430398,4,elpollo1980,09/08/2021,"Very nice and quiet place. With tables and barbecues, although closed in summer. It is a pity that bathing is not very good, since there is a lot of mud and mud. Too many mosquitoes."

82991,1159641,1,Iacedo,28/03/2021,Full of people and waste. Don't come on the weekend. I hope it is calmer during the week. All inclined difficult to find a level area. Tables and barbecues.

82991,984418,3,meschede,20/08/2020,"Very nice place right on the water, but unfortunately because there are no toilets there are a lot of toilet paper etc. distributed everywhere. In the evening the police came and we had to dismantle our tables / chairs because we weren't allowed to camp, but sleeping in the Bulli was ok."
82991,968296,3,aldipa,16/08/2020,"Place to spend the day, very good. with tables to eat and take a bath. tall trees which we had to set aside to be able to pass with the ac but without problem."
82991,967488,3,Atiflows,15/08/2020,"The place is beautiful and quiet, although the parking lot has quite a difference in the area below, next to the picnic area. There is no toilet and there is a fairly dirty area on the right side, which means that we have to be extremely careful with these places and collect our rubbish so that they do not become pigsty. There are fountains and garbage containers. The police passed by and didn't tell us anything."
82991,943132,4,mespinet,09/08/2020,"Very nice area near the reservoir. We spent one night in an area with a lot of unevenness, it was difficult for us to find a more or less level area picnic tables water fountain at the entrance of the path that leads to the area quite garbage near the water due to the lack of toilets"
82991,879451,3,lucas42,19/07/2020,"The GPS sent us the street on the left with low tree branches. BETTER go x barruti street. place with tables and good shade. enough people x the day, something dirty with garbage and handkerchiefs."

82991,542762,3,fatmarmot,07/07/2019,"We did night, at 2 in the morning two cars passed through the parking lot honking repeatedly, and at 7 o'clock in the morning the dogs of people who live in the area were already barking. At 8 o'clock the police went by car simply to check that everything was correct. All the barbecues were sealed by the firemen (I suppose because of the risk of fires). Everything was pretty clean except for cigarette butts, there were all around the corners. But in spite of everything, it's a great place to spend the day!"
82991,540894,5,fab-shilton,06/07/2019,"Shaded and calm place. The lake next door is perfect for cooling off, kayaking or paddle boarding."

82991,507902,4,nicodu24,08/06/2019,Quiet night. In the early morning there is nothing redibitory. little bucolic walk awakening very nice view. I confirm it as a good alte for one night. bin and bbq.

83018,3271189,5,KSNK,08/09/2023,"The complex has a very modern, attractive design. With a dog you get seats in the back area and the dog has to stay there. Prices are very high, a gin and tonic 11.-. In the evening there was nothing on the square or around the square is also nothing. The value for money is not right. 80.- for 4 people + dog."
83018,3248920,5,wjwenkeler,02/09/2023,"This is our third time here. family with 3 children. is also suitable for our large vehicle (12t) without reservation. prices until August 31st. 72€ (adults 10€, children 6€) from 01.09. 38€ (adults 8€, children 3€) great beach, great pool area, restaurant and also a great selection in the shop. super friendly staff. Prices are justified, but of course expensive. So the off-season is worth it."
83018,3101804,5,ptfamiliacosta,08/08/2023,"5 stars is not enough for this Camping. Fantastic resort: large plots, luxury spas, washing machines and dishwashers, large swimming pools, large supermarket and small kiosks selling bread and some products, restaurants, Take Away and bars, all with very reasonable prices. Finally, the beach begins where the Camping ends, it is almost a private beach."

83018,2867800,5,LuMO-2023,18/06/2023,"Very clean and well-kept campsite. The pitches are very quiet. Dogs are plentiful and welcome. The sanitary facilities are very modern and are constantly being cleaned. The dog washing area is also very clean and equipped with a hair dryer. Washing up is very easy thanks to the existing and free dishwashers. Takes about 5 minutes. However, the toilet cassette cleaning machine was the best. Also free. Would go there again anytime."
83018,2822731,5,Sinatwins,05/06/2023,"Beautiful, clean and very well-kept place right on the beach. Plots separated by hedges ensure privacy. Lots of activities for young and old. Registration uncomplicated, reception open 24 hours. Large supermarket available. Unfortunately very bad mobile network on the square (or in the area). WLAN is not free and at 6 euros/24 hours far too expensive!"
83018,2475325,4,ML1967,31/10/2022,"We stayed here for five nights at the end of September, the place is in a great location. It was the last week before the site was closed, the restaurant was closed, half of the washhouses were already closed, some of the shops were closed and we still had to pay €43.32 including electricity (2 people + 1 mobile home) per day to count. Way too expensive !!"
83018,2451375,5,KJFO,19/10/2022,"We stayed for 9 nights. Most fanciest campsite I’ve ever been to. Kind staff, kids plenty to do, they have possible all you wish for. 44 euros pr night with electricity, 3 person with a 5.5 meter camper. Most amazing part that most spots are 20 meters from the beach. This is far the best campsite I visited. Clean, tidy, safe and beautiful."
83018,2409778,5,HubertStrobel,28/09/2022,"We've been to a few places in the area, but we think that's the nicest. It's big, but if you want peace and quiet, there are beautiful places. Everything was very clean and well-kept. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We'll be back"
83018,2408637,5,charlysroad,28/09/2022,"Beautiful luxury campsite! Everything you need! We spend a lot of time on farms ourselves and loved having a rain shower here, being able to do the dishes in a dishwasher and enjoying the beach while the children sleep 15 meters away in the camper."
83018,2379741,4,HT6C,17/09/2022,"Top campsite in terms of infrastructure and facilities as well as (large) pitches. Direct access to the sea. Because of the price, only interesting in late season. For WiFi only 3G! Seems as if they are deliberately blocking 4G reception on site, in order to sell you their own expensive formula for WiFi. Because once outside the site (and also on the beach) there is 4G."
83018,2005149,4,Velester,24/06/2022,"Nice quiet campsite, lots of entertainment for young and old. Great sanitary facilities, a wide range of groceries, direct beach access for each row of pitches. One star deduction for WiFi costs of 6 € per day. Mobile reception bad."
83018,1936114,4,Robertzurdo,01/06/2022,"Campsite with many features, very clean toilet facilities and the latest. We missed more shadows and the source was actually a bit far away. Otherwise all right"

83018,1648514,5,siradriano86,17/10/2021,"Very nice CP. Very close to the beach. The pool area is laid out like a lagoon. Very nice. The campsite is quite large, but because it runs along the length of the beach, this is not noticeable. Very large parceled out parking spaces. All pitches have fresh water and waste water, as well as electricity. We'd love to come back."
83018,1623173,3,wildparker,02/10/2021,"Expensive and noise late into the night. On October 2nd, 2021 at 11.30 p.m., disco music from the stage made the walls of the mobile home vibrate. Was it spinning or was it a national holiday?"
83018,1587651,3,SabineDelling,18/09/2021,"Very nice campsite, but very expensive! Not just the space, but also the food and drink. The place is right on the beach but otherwise nothing around it!"

83018,1557583,5,Froeschin,07/09/2021,"Place to arrive and feel good, just perfect. Many direct accesses to the beach, on a flat coastal strip, bike tours are very possible, also to the excavations."
83018,1421367,5,RPB81,08/08/2021,"Camping top among the tops. It is expensive, obviously. The plots are gigantic."
83018,1347094,5,pilareta,21/07/2021,"Wonderful camping. Quiet and with (huge) pitches next to the beach. It is expensive, but if you want to be like real kings, I recommend it. There is only one area to empty gray and black water."
83018,1318321,5,gloria82,12/07/2021,"Magnificent and huge campsite, super well laid out. Several swimming pools, waterfront pitches with a kite and windsurf spot. Possibility to eat to take away. Everything is done for absolute comfort."
83018,1223626,5,MaKe2020,29/05/2021,"Very large, but also very clean campsite. Not the cheapest, but built almost like a hotel complex that offers a lot of comfort. There are several pools and the beach is very fine."

83018,358225,4,Atacama,29/08/2018,"High-end beachside campsite with all the amenities. Well maintained, spacious pitches, great comfort, shaded or semi-shaded. Sanitary nickels. High rates, but the location and setting are exceptional for water activities. Large number of foreigners, especially German."
83028,1109630,3,richywhl,30/10/2020,"Ok place. Even in October we had mosquitoes due to the bottom of the river being a bit stagnant! Lots of locals walk through here, not a problem, but not so ‘out of the way’. Quiet night(apart from killing mosquitoes in the van!!)"
83028,1001361,4,Ruta40,25/08/2020,"The beach is very nice and clean. It has showers but due to Covid-19 they are out of service. If you follow the path there is a campsite but we choose to stay in the parking lot on the beach. The place is very quiet, there were several camper vans and caravans in our same situation of not knowing if we could spend the night there, but we spoke with people who were already there a few days ago and they had no problems."
83028,877183,4,Johsuha,18/07/2020,"Very quiet to spend the night. The beach is also very cool, but the water is quite cold, as is logical in the area, and the constant wind. In mid-July there was only one restaurant open. The only downside is that the area is sandy and every time a vehicle passes it raises a lot of dust."
83028,573224,5,BuF,24/07/2019,Great beach but from noon all parking spaces are occupied
83028,315775,2,miguelag,05/08/2018,"Hello, I was sleeping and well. But at 7.30 I passed an official vehicle of Environment, and said that I was going to denounce them. I told him that the day before I called the municipal police and he told me that if I did not take awnings, tables etc, we could be and the environment, I did not want to denounce. I told him that this was a shame, that I was out of control. He told me to look at the Coastal line in the Google Ear, anyway, we were not comfortable anymore."
83028,315762,1,miguelag,05/08/2018,"We were, and indeed, in the morning at 7.30 an official vehicle showed up, and took pictures of everyone, and I personally spoke with him. I told him it was a shame, that they did not clear up with the police, and he made it clear that the law of coasts, does not allow neither to park, nor to sleep in caravan. In order to do what you want."
83028,297826,4,andreav,23/07/2018,The place is great and quiet. Only that at 10 o'clock a car of the Ministry of the Environment has taken pictures of the license plates saying that it is forbidden to park even though there is no sign indicating it. Many cars and vans parked. It is seen that he is a known character in the area who does it every day and in principle without further consequences.
83028,290824,5,tahityroots,16/07/2018,We spent one night here. There are beach showers and toilets. Quiet night and beautiful landscape. 3 restaurants next door. Very good location.

83060,2960402,5,windnomad,13/07/2023,"Spectacular place. I didn't see any sign forbidding staying overnight, so after a pleasant walk I decided to stay the night. As an anecdote, when I returned from the walk, I was surrounded by a herd of mastiffs, the ranchers were bringing their cattle down from the mountain. Advice: If this happens to you, stay still and calm. (information verified by the farmers themselves) You just need patience."
83060,1392510,3,helena.ikasten,01/08/2021,"There is nothing to indicate that you cannot stay overnight. We stayed one night and well, although an exaggerated wind ... If the night is peaceful it will be better."
83060,1342311,4,Technopilgrim,20/07/2021,We climbed without problems with Ac of 7.40 on 07/18/2021 although the road is narrow. They say that you can not spend the night but there were a couple of campers that had done it without problems as they explained to us. Small parking. A mandatory lakeside walk. Essential place in Babia.

83060,436194,5,tamanddave,04/03/2019,"Amazing views. Lovely walks along the lake and up the hills. One caution we didn’t spend the night as it was a very windy day, the wind was too much rocking the van about."
83060,318427,5,exterm,06/08/2018,"Great place to sleep, we arrived late afternoon (18h), a small bath in the lake, beautiful sunset, no one around! Do not hesitate if you have a small van to venture on the small path to be closer to the water and frogs"
83060,293279,5,KKF,19/07/2018,"Beautiful place of high mountain, we have spent the night alone and it has been a joy. As the previous comment says the space is limited to 3 or 4 Ac and cars go up. It is worth going up if only to see it. The lake can be seen from the parking lot."
83089,3220078,4,iPhonso,26/08/2023,Jen site to recharge and rest. Somewhat old but functional facilities. The good thing is that it is next to the Meandro de Melero.

83089,2268427,3,jdgraaf,19/08/2022,"Basic campsite with friendly manager. The tent pitch site is ok with nice shady trees. Some pitches in the first lane, just after the reception also look good for bigger motor homes.

Price of 17 euro for a small camper van, 2 adults, 1 child and a dog is ok"

The place we found the branches stuck to the roof of the van, the bathroom was very far, and for showers a lot of stairs. It is full of stationary caravans with their flowerpots and so on. With a lot of trees, with shade."

83089,1018547,4,HooLee,01/09/2020,"Friendly staff, cozy atmosphere, everything very clean and prepared for the Covid. The pitches are very spacious although the path was narrow. There is a lot of shade although there are areas not recommended for vehicles over 2.70m due to the trees."

83089,613394,5,Fanyle,09/08/2019,"Really beautiful campsite! Large plots separated by many trees from each other. We have a 2.90m motorhome and have done it just so grad. The owners are very nice even if we have communicated with hand and foot. Each plot has its own sink and power connection. The showers and toilets are very clean. There is a small Supermercado with the essentials (including bread), a large bar with terrace, billiards and table football. The village is tiny, but has 3 restaurants. In front of the campsite is a wonderful natural pool. The whole is surrounded by mountains and a great hiking landscape. You can pay by credit card and there is free WiFi. Highly recommended."

These are people who go with the car to run, intentionally bother, and if you complain you will be in trouble. Anyway days like this during the week you should spend a good night, calm as there is no activity or step of cars."
83139,415192,3,welikelife,21/12/2018,The place is not very clean there is a lot of abandoned waste and nobody to clean or pick up. We landed in a dirt road between the orange trees. It was quiet until bikers arrived and ran on the tar in the abandoned craft area. It got noisy so we left.

83270,2202585,4,fk30,09/08/2022,"Large car park near the beach. The town hall has isolated motorhomes in a reserved space. 2 taps for filling and 2 gray water evacuation tracks. All for free. A few young people in the evening on the sports field next door, but nothing too disturbing. Police monitor noise pollution."

Only two dogs that you should know: There is no shade and it is next to two hotel complexes (party music until 11:15 p.m.) and a soccer field and basketball next door where they play with music until 12 or so (although they are very respectful and the kids took the music off).

In addition, it is allowed to take out awnings, tables and chairs in the parking lots (7) reserved for ac, but at night everything has to be put away. In addition to what has been said so far, add that there is a wide range of restaurants, shops, a large supermarket and a pharmacy. The beach is very familiar, it has lifeguards and a red cross in summer."
83270,1913685,4,riosmarti,24/05/2022,paved parking with a privileged location. At the moment they are finishing the works to provide a water change service and delimiting an exclusive area for motorhome campers. I deduce that in a month it will be available. We have to be grateful to the local council.
83270,1813051,5,martitarm,10/04/2022,Quiet parking at this time. Next to the beach and a park that is very good and very new. No services. There are bars next to the beach too.

83280,3280952,4,LuisGonza,10/09/2023,"Area next to Cuchía beach where you can spend the night without problems, in high season there are many caravans and the rush of cars but it is tolerated, the only drawback is that there are many blood-sucking mosquitoes :P"
83280,3260455,3,monicote,05/09/2023,Beautiful place. It is somewhat uneven and at the beginning of the night there was some commotion with cars and motorcycles going up and down. But we were able to park the van without any problem. There were hardly any people
83280,3258253,4,Varelie,04/09/2023,"Flat places on the top but beautiful view of the village and the water and no service. Beautiful walks and beautiful views 5 minutes walk away. Slept well, no noise at night. Indeed there are mosquitoes, remember to put mosquito nets or repellents but that is the only negative point. Easy access for 7m vehicle"
83280,3256885,2,marthedela,04/09/2023,"Large place but actually the flat parking spaces are only on the top. Close to homes and the beach, passage of people during the day and evening. Nice little coves not far away. Big negative point, lots of mosquitoes, impossible to stay outside or sleep with the window open!"
83280,3251198,2,asivaztap,02/09/2023,"It's very good but I don't think it will last long because of the people camping, as always. PARK, DON'T CAMP, we're running out of places! If you camp, you whore us all"
83280,3198730,4,mdeandres,22/08/2023,Unbeatable views. Quite uneven. Very quiet at nights. Access to natural beaches.
83280,3163299,4,stephaniemurariu,16/08/2023,We arrived late at night in the middle of August and there was plenty of space. At the top the terrain is more level but as you go down towards what are the views it is a bit inclined. It is a very quiet place and you can go down to a small beach by a little path. We have dined and spent the night without problem. I recommend it!
83280,3161158,2,erlo2,16/08/2023,"Nice place, but very far from population. THEFTS IN THE AREA. City hall posters that they are not responsible, they robbed us in the Ac and the police did not appear. We filed a complaint 15km away and the police told us that they stole a lot. Municipality without police and the thieves know it. Few Ac and many berlingo type vans with only mattress to sleep, tables outside and no toilet or kitchen."
83280,3150141,4,Davidbtt,15/08/2023,"Good location, to spend the day and night. But not to make it a campsite, if we leave dirt behind, the neighbors are on the lookout, for good reason because their surroundings are very beautiful and clean. And if you're unlucky enough to have some young people next to you wanting to party and drink, well..."
83280,3140959,4,elturito,13/08/2023,"Almost flat, beautiful beaches, quiet, smelled a bit, close to the highway, with a view! If you like, you can surf."
83280,3139990,5,speyk,13/08/2023,"Brutal place to sleep, many parked vans and the further down you go the more uneven there is but it has incredible views of the sea. If you go down to the little path at the bottom you will see some beautiful cliffs."
83280,3071258,4,sebcampeze,03/08/2023,Great place with breathtaking views perfect for spending a night small restaurant bar 50 m from the top beach no motorhome convenience provide the sloping parking spaces.
83280,3069344,4,chapark4night74,03/08/2023,"1 night spent in a van, slept well despite the strong wind and the rain. Calm neighborhood. A dozen CCs or vans have slept there. Showers at the beach next door. The police made a round in the morning but didn't tell us anything"
83280,3066812,5,Pepperli,03/08/2023,"Nice view. I didn't see anyone with tables or chairs, but it was also very stormy for us. Dogs are tolerated in the beach bar despite the prohibition signs. Luckily, because dogs are also not allowed in the other restaurant. The view is great, but we didn't sleep well because of the strong wind. That was just too loud."
83280,3065142,3,duke620,02/08/2023,The campers overdo it with chairs and tables in front of the cars. The locals won't let this happen much longer!!!
83280,3061680,5,VeraLis,02/08/2023,"It's great, next to a beautiful walk, very flat, we arrived after 12 at night and there were 25 other ACs and campers. How critical, some with tables and chairs outside. 100% recommended very quiet and peaceful."
83280,3054903,4,JaisP,01/08/2023,"great place to spend the night. there is certainly a lot of traffic in the evening (groups of young people, cars) but the night is calm. we preferred it to the campsite which is 100m higher and which does not look welcoming. it is necessary to arrive at the end of the afternoon because it becomes impossible to park at the end of the morning so much the beach is taken by storm. a very nice playground nearby"
83280,3043646,5,brinask96,30/07/2023,"We spent a very calm night here with like 8 other campers. Perfect spot! Super scenic views and you can take a morning walk to the nearby beaches, the nature is amazing"
83280,3003196,3,AinhoaKamper,22/07/2023,"The parking lot is for tourist vehicles and it is a bit tight. The ACs park leaving spaces and they think they have the right to do so, and this is not the case. For camper vans, yes. But larger I do not recommend. The fried egg beach is special"
83280,2995812,5,temposleben,21/07/2023,"Beautiful small secluded beaches, if you like larger ones. The view was beautiful, it's a quiet place with not much around. A meadow with cows and lots of fields. Beautiful. trash can available."
83280,2948807,5,parkoamelo,11/07/2023,Very quiet night that we spend here. Beautiful beaches to swim! Such a nice view of the sunset. No one bothered us and locals were friendly when walking past.

83280,2923629,4,ThamelYambu,04/07/2023,"Asphalt parking, with parking spaces, more level in the first places. There is a very cool breakwater 4 minutes walk away. We do not remove tables or chairs due to old recommendations from other van drivers. If you don't want to be eaten by mosquitoes, don't make the same mistake as us. You sleep very well, cool and without noise."
83280,2906383,4,adepalen,29/06/2023,"No services, just containers. Normal vehicle parking, with very cool views. Neighbors complain about people pulling out chairs and tables in the parking lot, not about overnight stays. Let's try to respect everyone so they don't prohibit more overnight areas. Many trails in the surroundings to walk, bar, beach bar, viewpoint, 3-4 beaches on foot. It is worth spending the night and dawn there"
83280,2899683,4,JB22,27/06/2023,About 20 flat stalls at the beginning of the parking lot! The others are inclined. Some movement of cars at night.

83280,2840335,4,EmiMiguel,10/06/2023,"how easy it is to comply with certain rules and how good it is sometimes to not comply with them, they let us park overnight but not take chairs or tables out to the sidewalk, because we are going to respect a little"

83280,2694072,4,DannySteph,24/04/2023,"A quiet car park with really great views and a short walk to small secluded beaches. The parking lot is for cars and has a slope. but there are a few parking spaces. We stood with our 6 m camper quite well on one of the parking lots. No toilets available. Restaurant nearby and quite nice, but nothing special."

83280,2624603,4,sospiria,26/03/2023,"A nice place to spend the night with beautiful views of the evil and with many level places and many others without leveling. Be careful, on weekends the kids make a bottle and, either you go out with them, or you sleep badly."

83280,2346955,5,bjarnepaula22,06/09/2022,"The place is easy to reach and very large. There are no height restrictions or prohibition signs, and the local residents don't mind camping either. There is no service except showers on the beach and toilet in the camping restaurant nearby, which is definitely worth a visit. The view is great and the place is highly recommended."
83280,2342179,4,campervan95,05/09/2022,"Lots of parking spaces. Quiet place with beautiful views of the sea. In the area at the end, the ground is sloping, something to take into account when spending the night."
83280,2338302,4,PirminundConny,04/09/2022,"View and surroundings, beautiful beaches What really bothers me are the young people who probably rush up and down the street until dawn on purpose, making noise and sometimes standing next to or in front of the vans with their headlights on... provocation? And yes, the mosquitoes are terrible, about 12 mosquitoes on the bus and a sleepless night, too bad"
83280,2333245,2,ainaayz,02/09/2022,"The views are very beautiful but we have spent a terrible night. First, some young people came to have a bottle and it was very difficult for us to fall asleep because of the noise, and then there were many mosquitoes... A pity because the parking lot is nice."
83280,2315394,5,BulliAlina,28/08/2022,It's on a slope (a bit crooked) but the view is priceless and it's quiet at night. I stayed here for 2 nights and can recommend the place.
83280,2313714,4,Wastl95,28/08/2022,"You are standing on an asphalt parking lot with a beautiful view of the beach. There were many other campers here with us, it seems to be tolerated. There are two beach bars nearby."

83280,2286371,4,eduard.puig.montella,22/08/2022,"Very nice place near the beach, cliffs and some restaurants. It gets crowded on sunny summer days when people want to go to the beach."
83280,2277511,4,inravi,21/08/2022,Great view ! Very quiet night spent with family. Great parking spot. A little too much waste on the sides.

83280,2237660,4,manuaroa,14/08/2022,"It is a street that reaches several chalets with parking space. You can see the sea from here, the view is spectacular, and the beach is 5 minutes down a dirt road, and then down a street. It's quiet, there are a few AC and camper, and we have a roof bed. There is a restaurant and beach bar next door, 150 meters away (the same road as to go to the beach)"

83280,2186440,4,Caravanadominguera,06/08/2022,"Ideal both the first places in battery and the first area in line. Beautiful path on the descent to the parking lot that takes you to the cove of the egg or also a few meters from the Marzan beach. Close to the path to the beach of the horses. Beautiful area, highly recommended. Let's take care of it and respect rules since we are not well received for leaving a mark, eye!"
83280,2186379,1,Caravanadominguera,06/08/2022,"Let's see, I don't know why people go up so many places to park when it's all on the same street. And the best for an AC is the one with the highest battery or the first one in line. This one is uneven since it is downhill. All a few meters from the dog beach and the normal beach, but the other two parking areas are much more recommended."
83280,2125257,5,ekkofrenchie,26/07/2022,"We have been very calm. Due to the weather (cloudy and some rain) it has not allowed us to enjoy the landscape and surroundings, but it is beautiful. There is a beach 30 meters away. Yes, there is a slope in the one a little lower down, but here we have been fine without wearing shoes."
83280,2118708,3,SaraNeha,24/07/2022,"We slept in the campsite before reaching this place, but walking at sunset we have seen several caravans and vans to spend the night. Gorgeous sunset views, buckets at the end of the street, trails along the cliffs and beaches below. there is a restaurant and a beach bar on the parallel street. Some squares are fine others with a lot of unevenness"

If you don't go all the way down, you can sleep almost level without problem, quite a few places. It is encompassed in an urbanization of chalets. Quiet place, with a garbage container. Very windy due to its situation."
83280,1311144,4,roos113,10/07/2021,"Amazing view, and nice almost private beach for a good morning swim. Wouldn’t recommend to go there during the weekend like we did. Because it sounded like there was a streetrace during night"

Nice quiet car park, beautiful view to the town and sea. Incline, but you can park two wheels on the curb and the bottom so level out. A few cars were around, but they left around 8pm. Civil guard came around 7am, just drove off. Police came around 7:45am when we were leaving. Neither of them said anything."

83330,1734815,1,Elmarmota,16/01/2022,Caution!!!: people like to break in here or even steal the entire camper. I live around the corner and know a lot of campers/people this has happened to. here I would rather spend 15 euros for a parking space. apart from that the place here is very noisy during the day and at night young people come and make some circles with their cars.
83330,1734161,1,megaG,15/01/2022,cuidado !!! Sitio muy peligro if he keeps his bicycles ... I tried to spend only one night there and they tried to steal it from me ... left immediately

83330,1718138,4,DominikaR,28/12/2021,A lot of motorhomes despite December. The advantage is the proximity of shops. The night was very turbulent because it was very windy and we had the feeling that someone was entering our motorhome. Maybe there is dirty and forbidden company
83330,1711665,2,katkur,18/12/2021,In itself a good place for an overnight stay. Unfortunately there were car races for the campers on our night. Have then safely reparked the camper.

83330,1668294,4,liannebruggink,29/10/2021,Big mall with free wifi and a few restaurants. Sea in walking distance. Quiet in the night (I was there on Tue). Cheap tank station. Good for a free place to stay!

83330,1406382,4,meeryps,05/08/2021,Don't pay much attention to Google Maps. There comes a time when he tells you to go down a dead end. It is better to follow the signs for the beach and then go to the Alcampo shopping center and continue to the KFC. There you can park and you will see more parked vans and motorhomes. It is wonderful with the sound of the sea in the background. The beach is suitable for dogs
83330,1286075,1,pacoke,30/06/2021,"We slept on 6/14, on the way to Andorra. It is the parking lot of a CC and there were a little strange passersby. Next to the beach there are some garbage containers where at night there were about 10 large rats like cats. The area did not transmit tranquility to me, but being next to a beach is an incentive. At 500m along the promenade, there is a marina called Little Venice, which is beautiful."
83330,1283554,1,laura14477,28/06/2021,"We had a pretty good night. Next to Alcampo beach, gas station with water to recharge. Despite having many people we have slept well"

83330,1246343,3,chukymail,10/06/2021,"It does its function, noise at night. Fast food nearby. Be careful with Google Maps that takes you through a tunnel that vans do not pass."
83330,1231664,3,DavidParker,02/06/2021,"Good place outside business hours since it is a shopping center, next to the beach, if the air blows from the South, it will almost certainly be dirty, here it is clean when it blows West or North. It must be respected that it is not an AC parking, do not take out tables, chairs, awning, etc ... and they will not tell us anything."
83330,1199144,3,Ita-leo,15/05/2021,"Place is good, many super services, a leroy merlin and gas station, but the people sailor cloth .... caravans parked the car camping with tables and chairs and finally the usual will happen ...... a shame of water."
83330,1193452,5,LaBicho,12/05/2021,"Good place in front of the sea !! Very spacious, well lit and with many services! Some noise given that it is a parking lot in a shopping center and there is a lot of movement of vehicles but it is a very safe place !! The water tap is at the gas station, I recommend going after 22:00 when the manager is not there and you avoid telling you any nonsense !!"
83330,1176809,4,Saragip,20/04/2021,"We wanted to test our freshly finished van. The place is just as in the photos, the beach is for dogs and the truth is quite clean everything, at night very quiet, free Wi-Fi from the nearby centers and you can even choose the parking area with or without light. The only thing is that at 6-7 o'clock cars start to pass, nothing that is not solved with some plugs"

83330,1125661,3,kirobam,30/12/2020,"Parking lot of a shopping complex. There were a few more motorhomes with us. In the evening it became quieter. If you still want to buy things, you will surely find it here. Beach ok but you can tell that you are in town. OK as a short stopover, but then continue driving today."
83330,1107347,5,digitaldesignnomad,27/10/2020,"Large parking lot right next to a hardware store and supermarket. The beach in front is for dogs and anglers, the beaches next to it are for swimming.

83330,1043244,4,imhotepa,12/09/2020,"Close to the beach, which is allowed for dogs. Commercial parking, therefore of little interest, but clean. Toilets at Auchan open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. KFC Burger King and other restaurants nearby. Immediate proximity to the motorway, therefore convenient. We had a good quiet night, without too much noise (Friday evening). Convenient for an overnight stop, otherwise it's still a mall parking lot, so I can't see myself staying there longer ..."
83330,1015927,4,Jorge206,30/08/2020,"Quiet parking for the night, when we arrived (around 0:00) we considered changing our location because there were people with music and a lot of atmosphere next to the beach, but we were lucky that they turned off soon and we were able to rest perfectly. The beach is fine, but further north (past the apartment blocks) there are less crowded and quieter beaches."
83330,1003023,3,janireFer,26/08/2020,"Around 2 in the morning an alarm began to sound that lasted for a long time. Starting at 6 in the morning trucks maneuvering and with the engine running. Much or noise. Perfect location and dog beach next door, showers. I imagine we were unlucky with the noise."

83388,1526427,4,agallego43,29/08/2021,"We spent a very quiet night, we were only two campers and one AC. Just 100 meters from the beach. To put a paste the strong smell of urine and the difficulty to leave the parking lot the next day when it was full."
83388,1525520,5,carlalvarodero,29/08/2021,"Perfect for sleeping and going to the beach the next day. It is a bit tricky to maneuver with large AC, good for small and medium campers. The middle parking lot is the most level. We slept very quietly, only the waves of the sea could be heard."
83388,1499594,4,jotabarros,22/08/2021,"A few hundred meters from a spectacular beach that is magical at night. There are three small esplanades, the one in the middle is the one with more regular ground, 6-8 caravans or campers fit in the top two and perhaps 3 in the bottom one. Super quiet (it is in a luxury urbanization) and without a police presence. On the beach there are no toilets or shower. Super recommended."
83388,1423109,4,Berlingo88,08/08/2021,Good area to spend a night and go to the beach of the Germans. The Civil Guard passed at 11pm and I only drew attention to those who had things outside the vans.
83388,1277289,3,RAUL2304,26/06/2021,"We slept very quietly, the only bad thing was the uneven ground, in the morning there were workers working and they woke us up, very close to a very beautiful beach, you have to take everything with you, there is no type of service nearby, no bar or bathroom or showers at all"

83388,767533,4,DAVIDMARIABLANCA,11/01/2020,"Three parking bags for cars that in low season you can use as you want since the area is very quiet, if not deserted. Perfect to rest and start beautiful trails around the lighthouse area. The most level is the second. There are no services, poor lighting but very safe since it is a very exclusive area of villas. Beautiful beach"
83388,524784,4,bigshirl,22/06/2019,Stayed one night here in the middle of the three parking areas with only one other van. Easy access to beach but do take everything you need with you before parking as no shops bars or restaurants near by. Very exclusive villa area and lovely and quiet. Think I would try nearer the town if Zahara next time

I'm leaving, problems of coexistence."
83404,1658911,1,meliamandms,23/10/2021,The barrier was open and we entered the parking lot to park. Such a strong and unpleasant smell dissuaded us from staying. But the barrier had closed. Impossible to go out without paying through an app. A nightclub is right next door.
83404,1610795,3,llunadana,26/09/2021,The area to spend the night is well within what fits but if you are only going to empty and fill water you have to do it from behind the barrier
83404,1606966,1,ErnestJQ,25/09/2021,"The barrier did not open. After making the payment, we had to call the town hall and the police, who had to go to open the barrier. Also, the spout did not match several of our hose adapters. We paid, and after trying, we left with them, not without first calling the police to open it again."

At 4 a.m. we have awakened the typical polygon tuning nini with tubar ""testing"" his supercar salvaged from scrapping. It's almost 5 o'clock and the poor dogs of the neighborhood have already revealed themselves and do not stop barking. Good intention with bad location."

We didn't dare leave the vehicle another day."

83541,2581418,5,MarkusAust,18/02/2023,Huge parking lot! at 7.2 m it was not easy to drive in the parking lot as the lane was very narrow and car to car. Parking lot was full. Then found a place and off to the nearby town. Easy to walk. Slept perfectly at night and never felt unsafe. For me the only alternative to park a large camper in Porto.

It has a large swimming pool plus childrens pool and is only a few minutes walk from a beautiful lake.

The pool looked great, opens from 1-6. There is a beautiful lake next to the campsite. Great for walking. It's not bathing water."
83545,2611366,3,Bruzbi,16/03/2023,"Very nice place, friendly welcome. The service buildings are not heated, sometimes no hot water, it was never cleaned during the 5 nights, but the prices are higher. The surrounding nature made up for it."

Music from some campers at a very high volume, but after our complaint, the kind women at the reception managed to turn off their device (the next day, again the same, there are people who do not respect anyone). Except for that, calm down."

83545,2056115,2,jopinho6610,10/07/2022,"It's a pity not to enforce the regulations of the pool enclosure regarding the presence of pets! When there are animals in the park, which is allowed, the owners let their animals ""walk freely"" next to the tents, bags, chairs, etc... Not worrying about where the pet needs to go. An unfortunate situation! As for the positive aspects, we also know them and are described in several comments."

So can I please have look around so I can see the place and know what to expect when we are back? No, because the rules she said. Sounds fair, but I'm not coming back. Who knows what other rules they might have."

No water but it wasn't long before somebody from the ""marie"" made contact and offered an alternative source . Very friendly.  Sadly local restaurants were not open but that doesn't alter the fact that this municipality has made a superb facility available at no cost"
83549,2402052,2,josemleon2,25/09/2022,Without water (I guess because of the drought) and without signaling. Otherwise it seems like a good place in a nice town. We do not spend the night

Thanks to the municipality for this initiative. But why do Spanish keep installing watertaps with a push button?

I'm going to spend the night to see how it goes. Access is right next to a dirt esplanade with a booth, the GPS sent me to the main entrance of the children's park that is right next to it."
83549,1165856,5,kicocc,03/04/2021,Very well located area with all services. Highly recommended. The description I think is wrong as I think there were only 5 parking spaces. The rest was for passenger cars.

Makes us uncomfortable. There is a known naturist beach around the head but it attracts watchers here too. any solo traveler be wary. 
parking is uneven, large rocks, parked under a pine tree, expect sappy windows and solar panels. 
its a nice sea spot"

It is not the best place to swim, a 5-minute walk away you have a beach that is better but not incredible either. It is a good place to sleep and spend the day, constant shade. danger of rockslides falling on you"

83585,2243407,4,Levanteoffroad,15/08/2022,Nice place to rest and disconnect at the foot of the cove. a Crystal clear waters for snorkeling. Good place to spend the day and night. It has free parking for about 6/7 vehicles if they save space. It is an access step to a nudist cove that is a little further away from the vehicle parking area. It is close to the yacht club and a beach bar.
83585,2241590,4,Bicikiti,15/08/2022,"We have spent two nights and we have found it a nice place. Beautiful views and with the constant sound of the sea and from where you park to the sea you are 10m from the water. Access is normal, there are shady spots and if you are lucky there are small natural terraces with, of course, views of the sea. The only but is that there are a lot of single men passing by looking for something, but they have been respectful"

83585,1276053,3,Vanloosers,25/06/2021,"Accessible and good but small site. 2-3 cars approx. The good the proximity to the sea, the bad the noise of the cars and the amount of traffic. Random people pacing up and down but no problem"
83585,1220549,4,Cheloaa,27/05/2021,"Good place to spend day and night, although there is a lot of traffic and cars go by very fast. Little space for two or three campers always. Please, respect the area, we have already gone twice, to stay several nights, we have seen people from other campers who have left with their roll of paper to relieve themselves. For four pigs they have us all looked down upon."
83585,1212600,3,Martins1989,23/05/2021,Next to the seashore if you can sleep with the noise of the waves. We spent the night very calm. There is no room for many vans.
83585,1179456,3,IranBerna,25/04/2021,"Quiet place to spend the day and night, little space, there is a garbage container next to it."
83585,1125970,3,DebsH24,30/12/2020,"This place has gorgeous views and I spent a quiet night here. However, there are municipal bins on the corner so you hear people coming to dump their rubbish during the day.

There's another daytime activity too ... single men drive up and park. I found out why when I went to walk around the headland. It's more than just a nudist beach ;)

Bars etc  at the marina and a supermarket up the hill."
83585,1062472,5,Tabeaglnkn,21/09/2020,Perfect

83585,1042197,1,YEQU,12/09/2020,"A very small place, next to a very busy road, noisy and ugly. To park and take a bath it may be worth it, to spend the night it is not recommended at all. Cars pass all night and the garbage truck at 7.30 in the morning to wake you up with joy. A horrible place."
83585,821570,5,eyzulay,11/06/2020,"I have spent the night without problems on the way to a chalet as it is empty. There is a pine forest with incredible sea views. It is very quiet, with a fisherman in the area spending the day but it was great. There is only room for a couple of caravans, if you are lucky to find a place it is great to spend a day here."
83585,475485,1,julifg90,04/05/2019,"Place where there is very little space. When I wake up, I find a municipal police fine. In the morning a lot of people pass by there. I recommend other nearby locations before this site."

83607,2382849,4,isacedricv,18/09/2022,We took advantage of this place for a picnic by the water and a cool but pleasant swim. There is more water below the bridge. We were alone. The night is possible there but without view on the river.
83607,2325845,4,elhinchon,31/08/2022,It can be accessed by van without problem. It has a descent to the river. It has no services of any kind. quiet and cool night in the middle of August! we have slept alone
83607,1725316,4,Dede_l_Jean-ti,04/01/2022,"It is not far from the main road, the noise of the small stream covers the noise of the road. Not easy to lay flat ... without obstructing the passage. The advantage is the relay antenna right next to it, 4G goes all out from home."
83607,1721156,5,Bugeye,31/12/2021,"Very nice, calm place along river. Large plot of grass where you can put table and chairs. Little roadnoise. Gravel road is littered with some floor material(green); I picked up a lot so if you do the same it's clean(er) for people after you. Please make our world cleaner cause we're eating microplastics these days... All the best for 2022!"
83607,1554133,5,CamilleGerard,06/09/2021,"Good spot, clean, close to the river. The water is clear and cool. Perfect for morning swimming. Access is via a small, little-used path."

83607,844730,4,Mikebcn,02/07/2020,"The place is very good, quiet and the river very close, the road a bit stony, but short ... I think it is suitable for any van, I would not recommend it for motorhomes ... there is also 4g coverage."

83631,656591,5,One45,24/08/2019,"Relatively isolated place with a nice quiet environment. Beautiful views. Several camping tables with several barbecue pitches, no direct wood nearby. There are 2 Turkish toilets that are not clean and leak. A fountain nearby, garbage cans (all garbage, recycling and glass). Very good place"
83631,533030,4,MontserratE,29/06/2019,It's worth eating at the hostel. They make menu at a good price and the food is cooked and cooked.

83631,315912,5,osimarro,05/08/2018,"Spectacular place to spend the night and day. Barbecues, water and wc area. There is a spectacular viewpoint on the side. Try avoiding Sundays, as many barbacues go up Sunday"
83631,280735,5,Fovadi,04/07/2018,"Spectacular place to spend the day and night, especially outside winter season, since the sanctuary is on a high. We inexplicably slept alone, despite the exceptionality of the place. Our dog is happy to be out of the loose van and play with N'hug, the restaurant kennel there is. Countless excursions can be made from here."
83633,2648159,3,MontseFortuny,07/04/2023,"There are no services for AC, it is true that there is a large hypermarket, but we did not spend the night because the external staff was not reliable. Ample to park."
83633,277918,5,javivia68,30/06/2018,It is the parking of the football field Los Rosales de Caspe. We asked the local police for the night and sent us there. We came in celebration of the Caspe Commitment. Highly recommended Quiet site with supermarket nearby. Without services
83658,2527097,1,GerbenLimburg,23/12/2022,Fallen into disrepair. I drove straight on.
83658,2510090,1,womoschlumi,01/12/2022,where should mobile homes park here? The place is completely neglected. We drove on straight away.
83658,1968630,5,rlmrlm,11/06/2022,"Quiet bivouac with a nice little restaurant, sometimes even a live musical group, guaranteed atmosphere. Attention tennis ends late."
83658,1770797,3,Paulo56460,02/03/2022,Quiet bivouac far from overcrowded campsites. In this season the bar is only open VSD.
83658,1722314,1,BartBeuls,01/01/2022,"Quiet place but not cared for. We had to pay 10 euros to only use the location. That's too much. The owner was also very unclear. We stayed there 1 night and drove on to the motorhome of Xalo, 5 kilometers further. There it costs 5 euros with all sanitary facilities."
83658,1712191,5,jugohong,18/12/2021,"wonderful place! we are 2 people+ a dog+5.4m van. We paid 5euro for hot shower, toilet, water, electricity(AC). It's next to the tennis club. People who play tennis&padel come and go during the day, but it's quiet at night. there is a restaurant next to parking area. it is also good.( reasonable price too). We would like to visit here again."
83658,1701998,4,AlexBH,02/12/2021,"I recommend this place, Ricardo and Sonia new owners of the Restaurant, lovely people, good homemade food, you can park caravans, with some shower services, water, electricity, ask the manager of the tennis courts, also a very nice person."
83658,742203,1,Batding,12/11/2019,We drove saw the place and moved on. The pool was pea green. The tree in the middle of the parking area had grown too much and would have hit the van. The steep slope to the parking area has deep ruts in it that would have made it very difficult to get out of. We won’t return.
83658,580915,4,getbusgo,28/07/2019,"Really nice to stay for free in a place which has a bar (which serves food), toilets, shower and pool (the pool is 1.50 euros per person). Make sure you have cash as they don't accept card at the pool or bar. Very friendly woman who runs the place and it is nice and quiet at night.

There are flat areas but much of it is on a slope. Also, be prepared for a HORRIBLE step down/up out of the parking area. Thought our van was going to topple at one point! It's just about do-able though."
83658,524897,5,Vanlentina,22/06/2019,"It is a sports center with swimming pool, the people of the town come to play paddle tennis and racquetball. There is a chiringuito run by an Italian family where you can have a drink and there are free toilets and showers. It is a very nice and hospitable family."
83658,494448,4,Rond58,27/05/2019,"This is a great spot. The risk is that too many Motorhomes may create challenges especially if advantage is taken and the area is treated as a wild camp site. Please don't let this happen,!!!
To add to the benefits of this spot are the Bar and Pizzeria owners that make you extremely welcome while serving the best pizza you will taste!. Also serves Pizza gluten free.   Please respect surroundings."
83658,475672,5,dudululu,04/05/2019,"An amazing evening. Very warm welcome in this family that allowed us to spend a quiet night on their parking lot, prepared us a risotto of thunder, and offered us to use hot shower and toilet. A place not to miss if you're in the area!"
83658,451106,5,GeoMar,08/04/2019,"Would recommend this quite spot for a stay, we stayed a couple of nights and can agree with what others have said about the food and hospitality. They can offer coeliac standard Gluten free pizza. Better than any we could find in any Gluten free pizzeria in Italy. There are no standard camper facilities but you come here for the amazing family that run the bar/ restaurant."
83658,448733,5,maz64,03/04/2019,"This is amazing, a wonderful family run restaurant who make the best pizzas ever!!!! Very friendly and accommodating. 3 gorgeous children. Very tranquil setting, away from the best and track. Superb. Highly recommended and deserve support. MazandPaul"
83658,448403,5,chloecheese,03/04/2019,"A very quiet and tranquil place to park. We stayed 2 nights. The Italian couple who own the property next to the pool were friendly and let us use the WC and shower downstairs of the bar. Make sure you visit their little family bar upstairs for a beer/coke and to enjoy one of their **incredible** pizzas! They have 5 cats outside, 2 dogs (under control) and some very sweet little children ;)"
83658,431769,4,Elenbaas,21/02/2019,"Super quiet 21-2-2019 friendly owners, even want to make shower for you is private parking of small tennis court and swimming pool all for free. expressly request to no chemical toilet to empty, apparently previous motor home have done this just in nature, very sorry again"
83658,426065,5,Ania_szuti,01/02/2019,"Encouraged by the comments below we were eager to meet the owners of the bar as we were passing nearby. The area is quiet, and beautiful. The family is indeed very friendly, we spent couple of days together, sharing good moments, awesome italian pizza and playing with the kids. They were happy to let use thwir toilet and shower. Highly recommended."
83658,409350,5,vision,22/11/2018,"Wonderfully quiet and secluded location. As noted below, the people running the bar are super friendly and happy to have vans spending a night on the surrounding land. We had a brilliant experience and were lucky to stop here"

83729,3225580,5,toitoine170,27/08/2023,"Difficult to find, you have to continue after the shooting range, uphill, several places, at the end of August there was room at 7 p.m., on the other hand before August 15, a lot of people, no places at 6 p.m.... we had a little view of Hendaye, obviously leave the place clean.."
83729,3219774,4,Sergiocarba,26/08/2023,"The site is good. The biggest problem is the mosquitoes, we didn't move because it was late, but it is plagued and until we managed to kill them we couldn't sleep a wink. When going up, be careful with the GPS, it took us along a practically impassable path when there is an almost paved path (to go up to the shooting range). Some area with dirt, it is everyone's job to keep the environment clean."

83729,2980388,4,Lealhuillery,18/07/2023,"easy to access, flat land and can accommodate several vehicles. Many passage of walkers with dogs in the evening and in the morning. Provide mosquito repellent. Fine for one night."
83729,2766351,4,A.simonet,20/05/2023,"Easy access by small and medium van. Quiet place and night for us on a Saturday WE ascent. No busy road and that's great. We overlook the city and the bay well but in the middle of the trees so necessarily limited view. Too bad the place was dirty when we arrived (Kleenex, papers....) antennas and power lines."
83729,2720381,5,park4portugual,03/05/2023,"There are several spots along the way, but this is the one that had the most beautiful view in our eyes. It is also well shaded. The only downside was the back and forth of young men on motocross in the early evening. Luckily they eventually left and we were able to spend a very quiet night. Several residents walk their dogs but the houses are far away"
83729,2687940,5,HollyThompson,22/04/2023,"Amazing spot, spend a couple of days here and I got super lucky as I was ill with a hefty cold and didn't want to move much. Nobody here but me, only a couple of cars passed by and the odd dog walker. Very peaceful, plenty of spaces along the track, flat and with shade and a great place to go for walks with views over the town. yes the shooting range is close but it's really not that bad."
83729,2476743,2,Alizea17,01/11/2022,"Magnificent view of the city. Unfortunately, there is only one spot between the trees to see it well. When we arrived he was already taken. So no point of view. The place was calm.. Until 6:30 am when hunters literally came 2m from the van to shoot birds. Quite brutal and above all dangerous awakening!!! The place is not worth the detour, so avoid spending the night there!"
83729,2352328,4,Moby313Van,08/09/2022,Great place for a night! Nice view! In the evening an hour of loud Spanish music from local young people. We treated ourselves to a drink and danced. There are no rubbish bins or other facilities ... unfortunately there were also people there who also defecated at home in their own living room or bed. Please go a bit into the forest on the other side of the path.
83729,2270662,5,MCGoCa,20/08/2022,Beautiful place. Very quiet and flat areas. The road is narrow and uphill but we went up with a large motorhome.
83729,2212988,5,Jose-Pepe,10/08/2022,Beautiful place to spend the day and night. We were very comfortable and calm accompanied by other vans.
83729,2204623,3,Sarah1986,09/08/2022,"We were lucky and found a place with a great view, lots of mosquitoes, but slept very peacefully and stood in the shade. The next day we wanted to go to hondarribia for lunch, it was very crowded, some tables were free and we were still instructed, we don't come a second time."
83729,2183840,5,froglegeater,06/08/2022,"Great spot, spent 2 nights there in absolute quietness. Shaded throughout the day, very convenient on hot summer days. Excellent phone signal (french network). Most negative comments seem to have spent the night at the shooting range below. The trick is to drive the further few 100 meters on the small road into the forest, there it's quiet. Please don't leave any garbage or toilet paper"

With beautiful views, but at 8:00 in the morning the shooting starts and it gets annoying. Cars and people walking from early in the morning. But as I say, good place to spend the night."

83729,1005203,3,VolksVanTroopers,26/08/2020,"Good place in the middle of nature, very close to Hondarribia. Nice views of the sea. The pity is that, from what we could see, young people usually go there to drink bottles and there was a rather dirty area."
83729,976446,4,Davara,18/08/2020,"Very quiet place surrounded by nature, the forest is lush but from certain places you can have views of France."
83729,957117,5,TeoGarcia,13/08/2020,A great place to rest and spend the night. Quiet and away from the campsite and the city. It overlooks the beach between the trees. Let's all keep it clean.
83729,735184,1,Cabouillous1605,01/11/2019,"If you are looking for a salty and noisy place, welcome to paradise. Otherwise, I wish you lots of fun in hell. The place is clearly disgusting, extremely noisy (between the clay trap and its shots or the hill runs all night or the unbearable noise of the port below, you will have time to think about a comment to leave here) . Not recommended."

83729,556305,4,Nicolas8522,16/07/2019,Night quite calm. Two spots 100m from each other to sleep. A little isolated. Two accesses including a rather difficult via a track. We had a good time. A perfect place to spend a night.

It is a place to go to sleep while passing one night and in the morning to travel. It's fine for one night!"

83729,331158,1,minivantravel,13/08/2018,We do not stay to sleep here. Many bottle of alcohol bottles on the floor. We did not like it and we went to another place near this area.

83753,935132,1,abarketero66,07/08/2020,We came here with the intention of spending the night but even though there was no sign of a loss anywhere the forester came to us in the dark in a bad way telling us that he could not spend the night there and go to the Club Nautico car park. He took the picture and took our license plate ... See if there are any fines ...
83753,440774,5,ArturoVitoria,17/03/2019,"We have slept here twice, and great. Peace of mind. You have level place to spare. The entrance to the recreational area has a stone / stump to be watched, to avoid hitting the underside of the van. Totally recommended."
