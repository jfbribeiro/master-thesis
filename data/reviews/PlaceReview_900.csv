22089,2785303,5,GERALDINEJF,25/05/2023,"Perfectly functional area, everything available for free, contrary to what is written in all languages on the signs. Just open the hatches to clean the toilets and fill up with water. To spend a quiet night, go up to the car park, direction Monsaraz, about 1km."
22089,2636790,5,Lory-Grazy,03/04/2023,Excellent loading and unloading area
22089,2573622,3,Catherine47500,10/02/2023,"Perfect for emptying and garbage cans Paying water, 3.5 €"
22089,2362406,4,Vito1971,11/09/2022,"A service area for a very practical vehicle with free services: waste water, sinks, toilets, garbage containers with selective sorting. You have to pay for water (€3.50) and you have to call to ask for the key. No possibility of parking for the day or the night. There are places at the foot of the Château de Monsaraz. Large car park during the day only at the nautical base of Monsaraz."
22089,2314629,1,AnaOliveira3,28/08/2022,"To be avoided! Degraded, at the foot of rubbish bins. I do not recommend."

22089,1881280,2,grubaugh,10/05/2022,"This is only a service area. No place to park or spend the night. Change water, use restroom and empty toilet.  But no place to park."
22089,1775380,5,bbnij,06/03/2022,"Excellent rest area. Everything was open so no need to call for the key. It was a bit difficult to top up water, there was no hose on the tap and the watering can does not fit under it. Have used an empty water bottle (5L), so it worked. The nearby toilet is neat."
22089,1768890,5,bigcamp,28/02/2022,"Efficient service area, today it was not necessary to call the Municipality for the key to the access door to the water tap, we found it open."

22089,1089671,4,Merky,11/10/2020,"Thanks to the local council for thinking about motorhomes. Portugal continues to do better, that is why it is always our destination for vacations."
22089,1079722,5,marihue,03/10/2020,"An impeccable place for emptying gray and black water and filling with clean water. Totally free and with clean toilets, one of those places that are so scarce. Thank you!!!"
22089,1055071,5,sergionunes52,17/09/2020,Full and free service. You don't even have to call anyone. You have to reach and open the small door at the bottom where the waste pit is. We use the services before and after staying at Monsaraz castle. Very close since the castle has a caravan park but has no services.
22089,1019330,5,RicardoBila,01/09/2020,Full and free service. 5 stars

22089,706927,4,zenjepi,28/09/2019,Thank you for the information because indeed it's free but you had to know because there is always the sign indicating that you have to call to get the key but the local is free to access it's great
22089,630706,5,mgaivoto,15/08/2019,"Area for water changes and wc, even before reaching Monsaraz. The water door was open, it was all free. Has very clean public toilet and even on a holiday had toilet paper and paper towels for the hands."
22089,568063,5,Gijon,22/07/2019,"Very comfortable, water with a lot of flow. impeccable"

Toilet WC in the small building next door. Waste bins and selective sorting. Just a service point (which is already a lot!). No night possible. Thanks to the municipality of Reguengos de Monsaraz.
22089,396135,5,Novak,20/10/2018,OK. Open.
22089,377009,4,Bilas,18/09/2018,"There is an open blue lid where it is possible to supply water. Dumps water on the grate and pour the toilet in the toilets that are right next door, all at zero cost."
22089,246356,1,rio79,05/05/2018,You need to ask for the key at the gas station in another town. we could not download the black
22089,165427,4,davidsuroeste,04/08/2017,"If there is no water or it is closed, there is a fountain in front of which the water is drinkable, we load without problems, the tap is strange but with a universal adapter you can load water"
22089,92346,4,Yapi,10/08/2016,"Historic town of Monsaraz offers many car parks including one dedicated to ""caravans"". Huge potential, flat, breathtaking views of the lake. Quiet night. Great. (no service). (Yapi)"
22121,3213933,3,LuilliVan,25/08/2023,We couldn't park in the 6-seater area. If we did it in the first Parking. The train didn't bother us once we were asleep. Park next to a path in the background next to some lampposts and no problem. There is another parking lot in the background but due to the proximity of the station I decided better in the parking lot that you find when leaving the bridge. We went to dinner Bar cider house Northeast (Good).
22121,3202488,4,irisydiablo,22/08/2023,"Beautiful place, with a park with an area for children, barbecues, benches, etc. Containers and bins. There are not many places but it is a nice place. They could improve the emptying area but it can be done without problem."
22121,3141725,3,Sin.deentrega,14/08/2023,"indeed the area is small, six sites, loading and unloading should be improved. Next to a picnic area. Right next to it there is a parking lot where you can be. The train right next door runs every half hour. Don't stop visiting Candás, thanks to the town hall"
22121,3131278,1,saulexposito,12/08/2023,"You have to be careful where you enter. In my case there was a very sharp turn that I had to maneuver (camper 6m). The area is small and the fountain is apart from the area. In addition, the discharge of gray is not well done and can go to the motorhomes. We stopped to eat but left because the noise from the trains is unbearable. To make areas like this better save it."
22121,3111607,1,LidiaDePradenaMelero,09/08/2023,"We were in this area and we couldn't park, it's super small and it's in a very bad location, I don't recommend it to anyone. It is believed that this town already has a motorhome service by listing this area and it is not correct."
22121,3097308,4,arboldelevas,07/08/2023,"Area a bit small. Although it does its job. With emptying and filling although I could not use it. There was a queue and they recommended the supermarket Mas y Más. If there is no room, before taking the tunnel, there are two more parking lots without services. Thank you Candás for letting us be"
22121,3063426,5,Rochetty,02/08/2023,"Extraordinary small area but next to picnic area. Level and quiet, the train passes nearby but it is a very good area."
22121,2989916,3,MC4333,19/07/2023,"Good for parking and visiting Candás, it is also next to a park. Train passes very close, but it is not annoying. We went to empty and load water at the nearby supermarket, since it is more comfortable to maneuver. Thanks to the town hall."
22121,2982364,3,ConnorZik,18/07/2023,"Just a handful of flat little spaces, next to small park to relax in. 
Good for what it is, a small car park. However only 3* rating because the waste/water was broken and is taped off. We used the masymas services 2 mins up the road. They were great and clean!"
22121,2972340,4,lunamedano,16/07/2023,"Small basic services area but next to a recreational area with a field, shades and tables. The water spout and the water drain is on the outside, along the road before entering the parking lots."
22121,2928417,5,Fam.SchmiFa,06/07/2023,"We as a family with small children found the place good. Direct parking area with many tables for eating. 2 slides and swings, small skate park, lots of greenery and a small stream. 10 min walk 2 nice playgrounds. Supermarket and small shops, cafes/bistros also 5-10 minutes walk."
22121,2922931,5,AgustinDominguezMartin,04/07/2023,"Very quiet area, only 6 seats, playground, picnic tables, skatepark, all of this is the same area. water change and faucet ok. The train passes right next to it but it is not disturbing to sleep"
22121,2899405,4,stevievanlife,27/06/2023,"perfect for a short stay with option to visit the nearby village. Water filling,grey water, trash and 6 parkings. the park besides has a small nice river,children's playground, barbecue places and tables. i don't understand all the bad ratings from people that expect campsite luxury at a free caravan area. thanks to the ayuntamiento for offering this parking as asturias forbids wild camping"
22121,2651792,2,DeMira,08/04/2023,"We have gone to Oviedo, it is small, the cars park taking two places with freaked-out people who pimp you on top of that, the train passes anyway if it is necessary and there is no other option, well, it is fine, but if there are no better areas."
22121,2643746,2,asrlpb,06/04/2023,"It is appreciated that a town hall makes an area but to do it that is not next to the train and on a slope, a lot of noise, little space, it is not worth it."
22121,2633034,4,Catherine47500,01/04/2023,"Small nice and free area, beautiful view, quiet at night. During the day, passage of small trains, the station is just behind the area"
22121,2604734,1,Charlie0604,10/03/2023,"and once again it is clear that dogs are not welcome in Spain. In addition to the measly few places that are more suitable for vans, there is a small beautiful park next door, BUT dogs are not allowed. We drove again. Don't stay where we're not welcome."
22121,2603246,4,clentbiker,08/03/2023,Perfect for a night en route.
22121,2525231,4,Torpedo4,20/12/2022,"The place is charming, a recreation area and containers sometimes non-existent in other places, on the other hand, there are few very close spaces and a very poorly located emptying area. Access is much better if it is done through the parking lot that is just past the area, entering a little further on. Good initiative from the municipality of Candás, I hope others follow the example."
22121,2514472,3,Arto2018,06/12/2022,"Small parking lot with supply and disposal option. The parking lot is in the immediate vicinity of a railway line, which is not particularly annoying. A visit to the town or the port is worthwhile."
22121,2355018,3,MorenoCangas,09/09/2022,"Quiet area to spend the night but very abandoned services, clogged drains and trees with many branches can not enter."
22121,2219353,3,franjgr,11/08/2022,"Small (and beware of parking occupying two spaces in the nearby car parks, which fine you), inclined, the narrow water change area, with no room to maneuver and difficult to discover the location until you see someone go there"
22121,2174138,4,heinzelmannj,04/08/2022,"In high season (over) full. A few Womos stood outside the marked fields. Quiet night, the train traffic doesn't bother that much. The drain is impractical and with the fresh water you are voluntarily showered ;-). The town is quite inviting. Be careful when parking large vehicles in the ""normal"" car park: buses will be handed out if more than one parking space is occupied!"
22121,2153193,4,miguelparaca,31/07/2022,"Small area, a bit noisy. You have to wear shoes yes or yes because it is quite inclined. The worst thing is the service area, access is very complicated, although with a little skill it can be done. The good thing, it is 10 minutes from the port. Thank you Candás for putting an area for us :)"
22121,1890357,4,AlbertoLaura,14/05/2022,"Small area but with the necessary services, the town is very good for walking and biking with the family. Everything quite close, 10 minutes walk"
22121,1809074,4,PabloZ,07/04/2022,"Area that is very close to the center, walking, in 10 minutes you are in the same port, and to the bars and supermarkets, much less. The site is quite secluded, quiet, and you can only hear the train, since it is close to the track. At night it doesn't happen, so no problem. Also when it happens, it is not a very annoying noise either. The worst, the size, since very few vehicles enter."
22121,1805938,1,Mclouises,04/04/2022,"Area with only 6 seats. The loading/unloading services are very difficult to access. Be careful parking in the parking lot next door when the area is full. On March 27, at 1:30 p.m., several motorhomes were fined. In my case, €60 ""for occupying two parking spaces"", that's what it said in the complaint bulletin. It is what it is."
22121,1784957,4,flaquito,16/03/2022,Beautiful place in a beautiful city. It's OK for one night.
22121,1749338,1,chavo,06/02/2022,of the worst loading and unloading of water that I saw in my life.
22121,1737777,4,beboelpanda,20/01/2022,"Clean and quiet place. Be careful when loading and unloading water, the plants are well grown. The train stops running between 11pm and 6am. City center and port 10 minutes walk."
22121,1736104,1,Rasjahcor,17/01/2022,"Access is not as bad as they say. Yes, there is a tight turn but we with 8mts AC have done it without problems. It is appreciated that there is a place dedicated to us but nothing has invited us to stay."
22121,1733802,4,Fdlc,14/01/2022,"Area located near the station, few trains pass but it still circulates. All shops nearby. Nice walk on the promontory where the lighthouse is located."
22121,1701602,1,AnnabelleD,02/12/2021,"Difficult to access, Large camper van avoid going down very tight bend. A lot of noise."
22121,1688784,1,vlswitch,14/11/2021,"Service area difficult to access, gray water emptying not practical ... but free and fair spot for the night"
22121,1669921,3,trillonyotero,30/10/2021,Quiet to spend the day and night
22121,1515103,4,nomadaguapa,26/08/2021,"Area ok, a bit small, trains are hardly heard, thanks to the town hall"
22121,1462075,4,jga,15/08/2021,"Small but very correct, free services, skatepark, recreational area with barbecues, benches, swings, next to the outskirts, a few minutes from the town and the beach, quiet place to rest. the only downside is that all parks and beaches are forbidden for dogs."
22121,1337966,1,mariamery,18/07/2021,"The area is very small and it fills up very soon, so you have to go to the adjoining parking lot, which is also uneven, next to the train tracks and with a lot of noise from people passing by at all hours. I recommend going just 15 minutes away there is a very quiet area in Overo and for the distance it is much better."
22121,1268656,5,neumoultra,21/06/2021,"You can always improve, but I do not understand the people who put so many drawbacks, the town is beautiful, the area is fine and to empty it is solved with a simple maneuver, I hope all the areas were at least as they are, it is the second time that we come and of course the next time we come to Asturias we will return"
22121,1251481,5,salomontk,12/06/2021,"Correct area, six places, always full, with a parking lot next to it to park without problem, train next door, you can only hear it during the day x if you want to move to Gijón and cider houses and you will wake up with the crowing of the rooster"
22121,1225245,3,ToyTraveller,30/05/2021,Somewhat uneven places. But nice surroundings. Playground next door. During the day the commuter train passes by but it does not bother.
22121,1179968,3,HooLee,26/04/2021,"Low level area and narrow squares for larger cars. Quiet at night, by day you have the railway next door and the trains can be heard. 10 'from the center on foot. With all the services."
22121,1112658,2,onperdpaslesud,06/11/2020,"A motorhome area designed by people who have never had a motorhome! the water and drainage point is in a high corner that is very difficult to access ... and just before arriving at the area, you must pass under a bridge at a maximum height of 3 meters ... if you are higher, shop around!"
22121,1078035,2,aliciasasq,01/10/2020,"The water change area is not well maintained and is too narrow to access with the caravan. We don't stay to sleep, but we do hear quite a few roosters during the day when we stop"
22121,1072573,4,jagger4night,27/09/2020,"Visited with: Motorhome L = 7.5m H = 3.3m Good place to stop and visit surroundings. Positive: services, access and parking space Negative: away from the village"
22121,1026091,1,travelwithdogs21,04/09/2020,Very poor condition of the emptying and filling area. A / C. > 7 m difficulty entering and leaving the place. Rest the parking well. Recreational area next door. It is not to stay to sleep.
22121,945490,1,KUN71,10/08/2020,"Very small area. Very few squares and very narrow. Nothing recommendable. The emptying area is pretty bad too. It is in the worst place in Candás, which in itself is a pretty ugly town. The ideal would have been to have put it in the port, as there is a lot of room, wide and flat. But they leave us the worst place and it seems we have to be grateful."

22121,901992,3,Christine.chaya,26/07/2020,"There was no place in the area that is very small and we parked in the parking lot next door to catch the train and visit Gijon. At 7:30 in the morning, the police knocked on our door to ask us to leave because we occupied 1 and a half spaces, our AC measures 6.40. We were 5 BC."
22121,900095,2,gachero,26/07/2020,"A lot of space nearby to park, emptying the grays is complicated and everything gets muddy, disgusting, even so, grateful for having such a place. The townspeople are very kind"
22121,870141,4,dasafru,15/07/2020,"Very good and it is appreciated that there is an AC area, if it is full nearby there is a parking lot nearby, we stay in this parking lot. the train is heard but does not run at night."
22121,858906,2,merttasi,10/07/2020,Good parking spot near town but very bad service. The water inlet is not in an easy place. The outlet is beoken so it’s sprayi water all . Uae it if you dont have any other choicearound. The tap of the grey water is alao broken. No chance of targeting the grey water oytlet because it’s in a bad place.
22121,850439,5,varmente,05/07/2020,All the services. Very good picnic area next door. 10 min from the center on foot. We loved it
22121,780527,3,Inakicm,15/02/2020,"Area slightly away from the commercial area 15 minutes from the beach walking. Right in front of the train station, which makes it a bit awkward in the evening and in the morning for a good rest. Perhaps if they had located it in the parking lots below it would be a perfect area."
22121,752480,4,Alexander75,10/12/2019,"Quiet area with barbecues and playground,"
22121,710847,5,ahits,02/10/2019,"Good place with a short walk to the city center, about 15 minutes to the beach. great for families, large playground and park right on the pitch. Nearby railway line, if the noise of trains disturbs during the day should look elsewhere."

22121,654272,4,dani3lin,23/08/2019,"area with the best and worst. The best, which is next to the beach and a large picnic area with shade. The worst, the noise of the trucks entering and leaving the port. The places that it has with respect to the demand remain totally anecdotal, but you can park in the surrounding areas without problems."
22121,639602,4,timonel,18/08/2019,Nice area and well located next to green area and stream. Little space. I take a star for the bad design of the emptying area.
22121,632221,2,ea1qa,15/08/2019,"Noisy public parking area next to and behind the train, loading and unloading area at different levels of the squares. I think you could have done better and in another place more accessible. But thanks to CANDAS for promoting this tourism."
22121,601806,3,gregcaen1,05/08/2019,Very good because free. Calm. On the other hand with a DC of more than 7m and a trailer it is complicated but it does it.
22121,583221,3,crakis,29/07/2019,Very quiet area with a very comfortable picnic area next to the park. what small squares and with a small inclination. The very pretty town deserves a stop. It fits perfectly across the bridge. My motorhome is more than 3 meters and no problem.
22121,538614,1,LaMereDenis,04/07/2019,What is the height indicated under this bridge? It says 3.50 at the presentation and 3 m in the comments! All cpg-driver knows that nothing is worse than not knowing even to be in front of a bridge too short! The drama is to have to go back ...
22121,506416,4,Andrea-Dinis,06/06/2019,"Small area To get there you have to go under a bridge where the train passes, our motorhome passed without problem but I do not know if a higher one will have problems. The terrain is pending. There is a small park with 3 or 4 tables and a couple of barbecues. Little walk. And a sign that says forbidden dogs but I understand that it will be by stepping on the grass ... The area of filling and emptying well."

It has services and is right at the entrance of a park through which the river passes, it has picnic areas ... and the port is a little walk through several parking next to the river road. the train passes by behind but not by night. although there are 4 seats, they fit at least 2 or 3 more. we sleep 6."
22121,358892,3,dometisa,29/08/2018,"Bof, emptying area and water that's all, glued to each other, but hey it has the merit of existing"
22121,336013,4,CharlesHuertas,15/08/2018,"He does not have 5, due to lack of maintenance in the middle of summer. It is very unpleasant to empty and realize that the drain does not work. For the enclave, perfect."
22121,324845,5,Relizard,10/08/2018,No dogs. A very clean and quiet place to spend the night. It is worth visiting the town and try the local cuisine. Congratulations and thanks to the town hall.

We were treated to boom, boom, boom until 4 a.m. but it was difficult to know where it was coming from. Lots of things to see nearby, for the bus center No. 34 or 30 to 40 minutes on foot. A LIDL 5 minutes away, bus 34 is in the same street: Pablo GarballoInfo, if arriving on a Friday wait around 3 p.m. to take your place the parking lot empties, on Saturday and Sunday OK on the other hand be careful on Monday morning it's a rush the parking lot fills up quickly."

Unfortunately, the many free-roaming dogs in the village cloud the idyll. Dog droppings everywhere and unfortunately I was also attacked by small dogs. Too bad the place deserves something better because some people really try hard."
22161,2677874,3,Wesertaler,17/04/2023,"Very nice pitch. Great view of the place. . Very nice. The free-roaming dogs cloud the walk through the place. Unfortunately.

The area has been located in a place with very nice views, clean, paved, level... quiet area. The tapas are very good, there are hiking and cycling routes. A place to disconnect for a few days. More towns like this are needed."

The town has nothing to offer and it is ugly ugly houses built haphazardly and without order. Good alternative to Guadix. Before you go eat in the town and take care of this magnificent area
22161,2639463,4,CasitaNL,04/04/2023,"Nice place, beautiful view, nice service place. Great to visit the town. We didn't stay, because only asphalt, no green and very narrow places. A bare parking lot for campers."

22161,2608169,3,vrindom,13/03/2023,"The place is very clean and very well appointed. There is a very nice view of the village and to get there it is better to follow the signs than the GPS which takes you through narrow streets. A big flat on the water point. In fact, the taps are reversed: the clean water is loaded just above the black water drain, and the cassette is rinsed above the diving tank."
22161,2606178,5,BoxerPetite,11/03/2023,"Nice (new) motorhome with clean compartments. Beautiful view over the village. I do advise NOT to drive through the village because of the narrow and steep streets in the center. From the GR-3201, take the first road to the left (follow the signs Camperplaats). Later, explore the village on foot!"

22161,2529889,3,MarkJager,27/12/2022,"It's great that the municipality regulates this. It is only a camper place with little around. Elpeza is not very nice in terms of view. When you leave elpeza, you see the dam: parking there to take a walk is very nice. Places are not equally flat and very close together! Water filling tap above toilet discharge point is not hygienic. Lots of barking stray dogs!"

22161,2417084,5,Jbx87,02/10/2022,"Area at the top, pleasant place, friendly inhabitants, very nice traders, thank you to the municipality. Small downside, it would be good for the municipality to remove the small town garbage cans which overflow and attract flies... This would force lazy motorhome owners to throw their garbage 80 m away in the container provided for this purpose, at the entrance to the area and thus keep the place clean!!!"
22161,2407161,5,WOMOCowboys,27/09/2022,"It doesn't get any better! A great paved pitch with comfortable benches and a breathtaking view! Great hiking opportunities. Of course we also enjoyed eating and shopping in the village!! Muchas gracias La Peza, volvemos de nuevo!!!"
22161,2399291,5,Paichi,24/09/2022,"A great area and town. All very careful and new. The locals go out of their way to help you. We stayed two days when we were only passing through. All services work. He sleeps very well, even if you are a bit of an urbanite, the rooster will wake you up hahaha"
22161,2386597,4,Almaris,19/09/2022,"Very nice spot. Good ample standing, all facilities except for electricity and wifi for free. Great views on authentic Andalucia old village. Some nice pubs and affordable restaurants. We stayed 2 night and will return, if only for Antonia who walks her baby sheep everyday and cleans the camper place and waters the flowers."
22161,2370167,5,gladvan,14/09/2022,"A nice clean area with water, drainage. concrete parking but with greenery. A superb view of the village Very helpful villagers Thank you to the town hall. Please keep the area."
22161,2346959,3,emilydixcamperscran,06/09/2022,"Clean, new camper area with a lovely view of the town. Would’ve been perfect if it wasn’t for the teenagers loitering on the benches and making noise until late. Maybe our experience was just unlucky. We decided to move on to the parking by the dam instead."
22161,2337670,5,RumiOnTour9,04/09/2022,"Beautiful free parking space with enough space and lovingly designed outdoor seating and dining areas! The neighbor even came by and brought us tomatoes from his garden for breakfast. In general, a very beautiful and well-kept town. Thank you to the community! Very nice view with a very very quiet night."

22161,2323334,5,ipi92,31/08/2022,"A perfect place to spend the night, good weather even in summer, we got caught in the rain and slept in luxury. They have to deposit gray and black water, it also has a water source to recharge. A very welcoming town."
22161,2307056,2,Slr2906,27/08/2022,"a mob of lads occupied all the benches during the night and made guttural sounds while other shouts came from above, some campers chattering and dogs barking in the background... bad night. I don't think it's usual but just in case I won't go back. the area is clean, good views and level, although the tap is in the black water and the town is not very attractive."
22161,2292810,5,Tonyfishy,24/08/2022,"Thanks to the City Council for this area, it is a joy and everything is free, let's take care of it. Gray and black water and clean water."

22161,2257646,5,GregorioGutierrez,17/08/2022,"Exceed our expectations, very friendly people, good bread and cheese. The municipal swimming pool a gift against the heat. Very clean facilities. We will be back."
22161,2213675,4,Ferroo,11/08/2022,"The area is immaculate. Everything is great. I do not put five stars, because early in the morning someone has passed with a dog that has been barking nonstop for more than 10 minutes right next to the motorhomes. Surely it is someone who is annoyed by our presence and who has let the poor dog show us. The rest, all very well. Quiet night and very good view of the town."
22161,2142455,5,aixohopaguejo,29/07/2022,"Magnificent free area. You can't take anything out but there are wooden tables and chairs. Town of friendly people and good oven. It is true that the sun shines all day, but municipal swimming pool 150m from the area, €1 and impeccable showers. 100% recommended"
22161,2129519,5,encarnagusa,27/07/2022,"It is a great joy to discover La Peza, the area is perfect with very nice views of the town and all the services. We have walked its streets, shopping and a beautiful hiking route, we will return."
22161,2094575,5,cleachpn,19/07/2022,"A wonderful, unusual village. The parking air is well thought out, new, with enough to fill and empty the water. There were two other motorhomes with us. We even went for a bike ride in the village where the people were more than welcoming and charming."

22161,2015861,5,jlpc,27/06/2022,"Good views and quiet when the rooster sleeps haha. But I don't understand why the clean water faucet has a threadless button while the toilet tap has a thread to connect a hose. It's not logical. Do I take water from the one that has a thread, in the toilet, which is easy, or from the one that has a button, difficult to hook the hose? What will the others do? Why not change the push-button faucet for a screw-in one?"
22161,2004340,5,franruiz,23/06/2022,"Perfect area to spend the night. Quiet town and the area, in addition to being very well planned with picnic areas and everything, is very clean. Thanks to the town hall, an example to be followed by other municipalities."

22161,1970658,4,Muegge95,12/06/2022,"Free but very clean, relatively quiet and very nice for a few overnight stays! Unfortunately, the descent was very tricky, suddenly the weekly market and many roads were closed. Smaller trucks pushed through the mini lanes and turning was unthinkable. Unfortunately, we scratched our sides on trees, because there was no alternative, we had to squeeze past each other..."
22161,1963742,5,BerglebenWinterberg,10/06/2022,A wonderful place. ideal for children who can ride around on their bikes/balance bikes. stood here together with another mobile home. the best parking space in Spain so far.
22161,1956594,5,MarcMaryline,07/06/2022,"Perfect ! Thanks to the town hall! A small market on Wednesday morning. If the ""small"" bins are full, a little respect for the place please: the container is at the entrance to the area!"
22161,1910717,4,Himalaya13,23/05/2022,Very nice camper place with one big drawback: there is no shade in the afternoon and evening. Shade cloths over the wooden construction at the picnic tables would be very welcome.

22161,1896054,4,Fabviva,17/05/2022,"Nice place, clean, spacious and very well maintained in general. The only drawback is that the access road to the area has a tree that tall motorhomes rub against and can scratch the solar panels."
22161,1895624,5,Eve10,17/05/2022,We visited the beautiful village and spent a very restful night. The area is very well equipped and what a view!! Thanks to the community

22161,1878364,5,Dalakker,08/05/2022,"Quiet, beautiful views, comfortable picnic tables. Drinking water withdrawal annoying by push button. Neither a threaded connection nor a common diameter. The nearest baker has great bread. Thanks to the city for this free SP! The surrounding area is beautiful including Marchal with its troglodyte houses and the snowy mountains of the Sierra Nevada."
22161,1872812,4,rvanvugt,06/05/2022,"A wonderful initiative of the town and therefore a big ""thanks"". Fully tarmacked, clearly marked parking bays, good facility for dumping used water, but not understandable why they mounted such water tap with pressing-knob. I attached a strap, hopefully nobody removes it. I spend some nights here, and every now and then dogs are barking, but no earplugs needed. Quiet, good views, hiking possible."
22161,1872523,3,swifteurope,06/05/2022,"this is a nice place with good cycling and walking in the area. However, there are a lot of dogs barking all the time."

22161,1867763,5,Aleos,03/05/2022,Very nice and new free parking space. Very quiet and safe. It's a lot of fun to walk through the village. You can hear a lot of barking dogs at night but it's not that bad.
22161,1867578,5,Leoniemichelle,03/05/2022,Great space with a beautiful view. This is how we imagine a traditional Spanish village. The dogs are listening but didn't bother us. We felt very comfortable here and can only recommend this place. Mobile bakers drive around in the village and are happy to have customers.
22161,1858090,5,FeeeNdr,28/04/2022,"Impressed with this motorhome area which is recent and well signposted. The village has done its utmost to ensure that travelers have a good stay. Free and fully functional services. We slept very well, without being disturbed by the animals of the villages. Thank you to the inhabitants and to the city!"
22161,1855290,3,solenskinner,27/04/2022,"Very nice place and friendly helpfull people in the town. But very noisy in the night. Barking dogs all the time and later at 4 o'clock Roosters are taking over....looong night. But hey, you are at the Country Side and thanks for a safe night :)"

22161,1829175,5,HectorHoose,16/04/2022,"Beautiful location, immaculate Aire with wonderful views. Village bars are very welcoming & lovely walks to be had. Only downside is the large number of loose village dogs that bark, chase visiting dogs & mess everywhere. Although they are friendly. Spent 3 days here & would definitely come again."
22161,1828869,5,MariLoliMO,16/04/2022,"A great area. Thank the council for the effort made. But we, as users, must also do our part in maintenance. There are rubbish bins at the entrance to the area and despite this there are bins full of rubbish bags. Please, container the garbage."
22161,1817118,5,Danielrdguez,12/04/2022,"The area is very good, next to the town, very good initiative. The town is not pretty, I'm sorry to say but it is like that, it has no incentive, we went around to see it and it was deserted, almost all the houses in ruins. The landscape is very beautiful because you are in the mountains."
22161,1809216,5,MaJuBosee,07/04/2022,"What a great pitch! Asphalted, clean V + E, a fantastic view of the place and all for free. A big thank you to the community! It's just a pity that fellow campers let their dogs run free, which then go everywhere. A little respect would be appreciated."
22161,1807142,5,GrahamTodd,05/04/2022,Thank to the town for providing such a beautiful area. Everything is perfect.

22161,1798827,3,cam91,28/03/2022,"Great land, but against a small village not great. Nothing to see, dog on the loose so if you have a dog to walk it be careful ⚠️ very suspicious villagers..."

The emptying of black water very well done. For emptying gray water excellent, and filling very well. Everything very clean, very well organized. There is a garbage container, and the descent to recycle. Wonderful on the part of La Peza. Thanks!"
22161,1783436,5,barou,14/03/2022,Magnificent area with superb view of the charming village of La Peza. Limited to 48 hours. Operational and free services.

22161,1780784,5,itzi,12/03/2022,"It is not only a place where the city council installs to spend the night and empty, it is a place with great pleasure in a wonderful enclave with spectacular views. To make a few routes and walk through the town and taste its typical dishes and finger-licking desserts."
22161,1778353,4,GuidoPelagos,09/03/2022,"Fantastic Drive to this town and great view from the parking area. Free water and usage of drain. Simply wonderful.  Stayed 3 nights. 
Nice people and good views from top of surrounding mountains, good hiking.
4 stars because at night the sound of barking dog(s) nearby is non-stop and can affect your sleep. Bring earplugs."

22161,1762364,5,JacquesetAudrey,21/02/2022,"A beautiful view. Thank you to the municipality for making this site available, tarred and with delimited pitches. One annoyance, however. This young motorhome driver who evacuated his black water in the space reserved for gray water. When I pointed it out to him, he replied that he didn't know where it was. Lamentable."
22161,1762122,5,pericoGR,21/02/2022,"Asphalt area delimited and well located to visit the town, with the necessary services and clean... Do not forget to stop by the Oscar bar and its traditional bakery... Thanks to the municipality for the initiative and good reception..."
22161,1761500,5,josefcloud,20/02/2022,"We were there on February 17th. the place is new, very clean and close to the rather small town. the drive there from the north is geologically gorgeous and worth driving slowly. During the day the dogs ""work"", at night it was quiet. The disposal station with water works perfectly."
22161,1761467,5,suroto,20/02/2022,From the comments we knew it was a good motorhome area but it has exceeded all our expectations. Wonderful views of the town. Bravo for the municipality of La Peza
22161,1761162,4,Gerd247,20/02/2022,"Very nice place, but only small parking spaces and since many come with trailers, there are fewer than the 20 places given above! A lot of dogs barking from the place."
22161,1759743,5,autobusero16,19/02/2022,"very beautiful area, the charming town and the wonderful people and attentive to us they always ask if we are from the motorhomes and they give you the information you need a 10 to the Town Hall of La Peza by the way bar Óscar a 10 also without detracting from the others"
22161,1754608,4,Haemmi,13/02/2022,"Everything is new, so the site is very nice. It's a designated parking area for motor homes, the plots are small, only half of them were occupied, so it was okay. Please note, that camping is not allowed, max stay 72 h. Nice view over the village."
22161,1752873,5,maminos,11/02/2022,Thank you to the authorities for this magnificent brand new achievement with a splendid view of the village what more could you ask for a thousand thanks
22161,1752646,5,AGZ,11/02/2022,"great area. All new and well cared for. To put some fault, the clean water tap does not have a thread and it is difficult to use. Very pretty town, with Mozarabic reminiscences, narrow streets and a church built on top of a mosque. Thanks to the town hall for thinking of our group. Now it's up to us to be responsible and take care of the facilities."
22161,1749990,5,Krambambuli,07/02/2022,nice place with a great view of the town...it's worth the journey.
22161,1747734,5,MDolores80,04/02/2022,Very good area to spend the night with views of the town. quiet night
22161,1746449,5,Hobby17,03/02/2022,"Follow blue/white autocaravannes signs on entering town. The area is now finished and has marked bays for 20 vans. A covered picnic area with tables and seating to admire the lovely view of the town. Small rubbish bins but a larger container at the entrance. A great spot, 7 minutes walk to bars etc. Found the bread shop mentioned but is was closed at 5pm."
22161,1743449,5,ladystonee,29/01/2022,"Totally recommended. The faucet in the wc part is threaded, the pressure washer WITHOUT a thread. The bread at Julian's Bakery is amazing."
22161,1741427,5,kikerc78,26/01/2022,"Magnificent place to spend the night with ample parking spaces, water, emptying of grays and blacks. There is a small pergola with benches and tables to eat and views of the town. Easy to get to. Quiet. A couple of bars nearby and a small route to the castle from where you can see the town and surroundings. Very good initiative by the town hall to have this space for motorhomes."
22161,1741244,4,BunnyW,25/01/2022,"Easy to find, clean, well spaced, plentiful bays. Great view over village. Super bar nearby, Oscar's, which fed us well. A bit noisy in early hours with barking village dogs and an inconsiderate driver hooting their horn in the village at 5am! Grey/black water disposal. You can fill your water tank up but only by watering can as there is not a tap with a hose connection. All in all, excellent!"
22161,1741128,5,Trottie,25/01/2022,"We stayed here overnight to visit Granada early the next day and park there safely with our bus camper next to the station. Brand new and quiet camper place, a few bars, knock on the door of the bakery. Went with the electric bike to the mirador above the village to enjoy the view."
22161,1740894,5,isabellaoh,25/01/2022,"Only just stopped to use the services and have lunch but seems like a very quiet, clean and new area. The view and location is great too and there are many benches and picnic tables. Only 3 other motorhomes when we were there, so plenty of space. The drive in through the red cliffs is beautiful and it’s an easy entrance through the outskirts of the town."
22161,1740085,5,volitans,23/01/2022,"We only briefly stopped to use the services. Nice view. 
Some Germans (as friendly as a kick in the balls) kind of took over part of the place, but it seemed quite nice to spend a night. The town was really quiet.
Thanks so much to the town for making such a clean and nice place (and free camper service) available."
22161,1738716,4,hapi05,22/01/2022,"Everything you need is there, except external toilets or showers. Drinking water, gray water disposal and chemical toilet disposal. Enough space!"

The area has many well-marked hiking, biking and riding. Many thanks to the people of La Peza. Oh, fellow campervanners, please use the large bin at the entrance to the area and don't overfill the smaller bins. Best of all, use the recycling bins at the bottom of the hill!"

(Drainage of dirty water, chemical wc, water) To better respect the premises, there is a garbage container at the entrance to the car park, because the small bins on the site are quickly filled."
22161,1725656,5,MALI34,04/01/2022,"Very nice view of the village. Impeccable, new area. It remains to find a restaurant and everything will be perfect. Just a negative point, the thread (to fill with drinking water) on the water tap above the cassette emptying, would have been better placed on the other side because people use it to clean the K7s ..."
22161,1725284,5,Javierliebana,04/01/2022,"Congratulations to the people of La Peza and thank you very much, clean, level and very well located area. From the town square you can enjoy a variety of trails. We will repeat."

22161,1724788,5,Detourer,03/01/2022,"We stayed here on the 2/1/22. It's an aire which has had a lot of money spent on it recently. Spotlessly clean & all facilities working, well signposted with easy access. Many thanks to the Ayuntamiento for creating this area for us. The least we can do in return is to spend a little money in the local businesses of this tiny town."
22161,1724091,5,JuanPedroMunozAntolinos,02/01/2022,"Very new area, quite a few squares although very busy. Upon arrival there were only two places left. The City Council is great for thinking this way of us and its people due to the tourism it leaves behind."
22161,1722464,5,cecettoto,01/01/2022,"this area is great! Well appointed, clean, all services free and quiet. Nice view of the village."

22161,1717585,5,LesChoupis1et2,28/12/2021,"We stopped just to empty black and gray water and refuel our 20 and 10 liter cans for free. Thanks to the municipality, it's recent, it works, it's great! the town is super quiet, several large van parked there at the time of our visit this morning"
22161,1716524,5,eliasperez,27/12/2021,"Excellent viewpoint, quiet night and with all free and new water services. Highly recommended Thank you La Peza City Council."
22161,1716345,4,Navajas,26/12/2021,"Area with very nice views. Asphalted land that has all the services, except connection to electricity. It even has picnic tables. Thank you City Hall, for this beautiful initiative."
22161,1715577,5,JoBlum,25/12/2021,"Very neat parking space. With several PicNic tables. Water and disposal. A big thank you to the community! In addition, the disposal point was converted to be ""barrier-free"". The campers no longer have to drive over a curb! Optimally solved for this 5 *!"
22161,1715145,5,EGPH,24/12/2021,"Brand new large and panoramic area, in the evening it seems to see a small nativity scene! Fully functional loading and unloading (the flow of the loading water is a bit slow). There isn't much in town at the moment but at the top of the town there is a place where they sell goat cheese at great prices! Recommended!"
22161,1714673,5,ClaudiaGrabs,23/12/2021,We recommend. We spent a very quiet night.
22161,1713395,4,corinnehebert,20/12/2021,"recent area, clean, we slept peacefully and a beautiful view."
22161,1712818,5,lunitalamasperita,19/12/2021,Fantastic area and lovely townspeople. Very good work from the city council. He has completely thrown himself in with us at the official opening. Fixed the only one on the step of the emptying area. A 10.
22161,1712105,5,dudu981,18/12/2021,"Today the mayor officially opened the parking lot. It has all the free services, they have fixed the tap and the curb to make the emptying. Recommendable."
22161,1710683,5,rodrigo,15/12/2021,"phenomenal town at the foot of the Sierra Nevada, with dreamy corners, hiking trails, bars, bakery ..."
22161,1708910,2,lgte,12/12/2021,"I've been living and traveling in a van for a year and a half and I've never seen anything like it. To be able to empty and catch water, you have to climb too high a curb. a camper had to wear his shoes to get on the curb. That curb can damage the wheels or even the underside of the van. and the taps are not threaded. the parking is great and the place nice, a shame."
22161,1707453,4,micha73el,10/12/2021,"The parking space has become quite nice, you can't complain about that. Many thanks to the community for this free space. Fresh water tap unfortunately without screw thread, so you have to do something different. The only thing that bothered me were the many yapping dogs here in town. That went without a break. Please take your rubbish with you."
22161,1707142,4,rebelmoto,09/12/2021,"very nice area overlooking the village, existing services but not practical. quiet night. bar restaurant chez oscar nearby."
22161,1707139,4,josemileo,09/12/2021,"The place is great, if I marked the access, I would not have had to break my rear-view mirror, we are not cars, they have to clearly mark the access for us"
22161,1704753,4,jcsgalvez,06/12/2021,Very good area with good views of the town and emptying and filling area. The curb should be smoothed out. Be careful when accessing from Cortes. If you choose the scenic route it is very tortuous. Very quiet night. Grateful to the City Council.
22161,1702776,5,estrubani,04/12/2021,"Well equipped area and close to town. We spent a quiet night (the bells do not ring at night as they said in some comment) with several vans and ACs. The access is good, we are going with an AC of 7.5 m. Thanks to La Peza for facilitating this area, it allowed us to rest on our route to Malaga."
22161,1692584,4,frintropergrill,18/11/2021,"Good parking space, everything you need. Great view. Do not drive very closely with the mobile home in the place"
22161,1691376,5,tarracosirius,17/11/2021,We have been very well. Quiet and with a viewpoint of the Village.
22161,1682753,5,papple,08/11/2021,"Unexpected CS area, clean and fully functional. At 200m you will find Julian's panaderia which helps you to start the day well"
22161,1680162,5,ML35,06/11/2021,"2 nights spent in this parking lot. Very nice view of the village accessible on foot. Friendly locals. Other campsites because present, good atmosphere. We felt very safe. Quiet nights."
22161,1665207,5,vdanube,27/10/2021,"Quiet night. the area is completely paved and redone. no problem with the hens, the bells do not ring at night but just during the day. maneuvers are difficult if you have passed through the village (beware of big guys,) but you can get around"
22161,1664062,3,mariohs,27/10/2021,"It is a town, with its people, its dogs, its roosters, but like all towns it has a church with its bells, and they ring all night every hour. The area well, with a stepped curb that I think is like this to give elevation and inclination to the gray grid ????????"
22161,1660344,5,dami,24/10/2021,Quiet place with beautiful view of the village. walk to the castle. we bought cheese from the calle sa anton cheese dairy. it is a little on the heights of the village .excellent!
22161,1658378,5,Sarlauma,23/10/2021,Nice place. Great sunset. You need wedges / height adjustment to stand straight.
22161,1656376,5,cocoturkoiz,22/10/2021,Thank you for this beautiful brand new free area with 1 magnificent view in the middle of the chickens facing the village only negative point to empty the wastewater you have to climb 1 mimi sidewalk not obvious the road to go there is just magnificent when you pass by the dam thank you to the town!
22161,1650980,4,chrisoverseas,18/10/2021,"A good Aire whose base is tarmac. Lovely view over the village but beware of driving into it as it is very, very narrow, with some sharp turns. Take first left as you enter the village. The services are ok but it’s a high lip to negotiate to empty waste."
22161,1627774,5,sillysausageem,05/10/2021,"Very quiet and lovely view, smooth surface that has been redone since the photos shown but we used levelers as it isn't totally flat. The fresh water and dumping grey or toilet water isn't as bad as described in some reviews."
22161,1620862,5,claudioedany,01/10/2021,Very nice and quiet place with water and drain.
22161,1612244,5,mm-bs,27/09/2021,"Nice, quiet and clean parking space with all facilities, also free of charge. Underground asphalt were happy to stand here, thanks to the city administration"
22161,1611994,5,lescinq,27/09/2021,"Another superb service area, here there is a brand new bidume coating, here it's super clean and the view is magnificent over the village. thank you the municipality for offering us this place. we recommend for peace of mind."
22161,1604046,5,Cristina83,24/09/2021,Very nice place. Spent two nights here and felt very safe as a woman traveling alone.
22161,1603969,4,vikiub,24/09/2021,"The area is newly paved, with water services, emptying and filling, and chemical, the only drawback is the step that there is to empty grays, too high. Otherwise it is a very beautiful area, overlooking the town."
22161,1522141,4,iguerrero,28/08/2021,Panoramic views. 200 meters from the town. Very quiet area. It's Friday in August and there hasn't been a bottle around here. Loading of water and cleaning of sewage. The gray discharge zone has an incomprehensible step. It must have been a mistake. Some unevenness in some areas.
22161,1506544,3,Villegas10,24/08/2021,"Nice views and correct place. Not recommended if you are traveling with dog companions. Nighttime noise of hunting shots, chickens and barking dogs."
22161,1369968,4,JustCat,27/07/2021,"Very good views of the village, tranquility and shadows at the foot of the Sierra Nevada. It would only be necessary to improve access to gray water (with the ramps of the van you climb perfectly). Black water and to fill perfect."
22161,1256941,1,elmulo,15/06/2021,"The site is beautiful, but the gray cast I don't know how they think the cars will go up, with the curb cut they have put ......"
22161,1192531,2,ferpb,11/05/2021,"Good to spend the night, quiet and good views. Absurd design of the space for emptying water! A curb of considerable height to which you have to climb, I cannot empty. The filling tap is not the most appropriate either"
22161,1155059,3,tonypaella,21/03/2021,"They are making it an official camper place. Water column is already in place but is not finished yet. There is a reasonable chicken coop just below the place where a lot of clucking is coming from, I am curious this night and tomorrow. The Komo Komo supermarket is located in Plaza Jose Fernández Castro 2"
22161,776559,3,valou06,05/02/2020,"Municipal parking lot a little cluttered with site equipment and manure, where the garbage truck is parked. Just above, a small parking lot under the cemetery, for 2 motorhomes, approximately level. Very pretty, welcoming village (some people speak French at the town hall and at the grocery store), with a few walks around. Unfortunately dogs bark almost 24 hours a day and howl at night."
22161,412231,4,Evajilo,06/12/2018,"Level, nice views, but it's a parking lot for the village waste"
22161,406551,4,semperparvus,11/11/2018,"Parking in front of the town. Access for any size of vehicle. It has no shadows or services, but it is quiet. Currently used as a municipal warehouse, so you can find lots of sand and other objects. The City Council should clean it and provide it with emptying / filling service. The town is small and cozy."
22161,405818,3,emjauk,08/11/2018,"Great view of village. Nice walk up to view point - turn left out of CP and follow road, uphill about 20 mins. Decided not to stay the night. CP is like council yard, sand, bin lorry and mattresses. Uneven ground and lots of dogs barking in the village."
22161,299744,3,SLP,24/07/2018,Quiet parking Without services View of the town. Ideal to go for tapas and sleep peacefully ...
22161,231209,5,roser61,31/03/2018,"Parkin very trankilo beautiful views of the town, you can climb the castle where you have good views too, great bread and sweets or tell you, if you pass by do not miss it"
22161,225867,4,sokoliezt,05/03/2018,"Village of Moorish architecture, passes Camino de Santiago via Moorish, Transnevada MTB route. One of the old roads to the city of Granada."

22179,3182777,4,GregorioCorrales,19/08/2023,Very good place to park.
22179,2828644,4,DavidBeti,07/06/2023,"Public parking within the permitted limit of AC circulation. Shaded, paved parking with landscaped flower beds. It's halfway level. Asphalted. On Friday there is a market from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., so parking is prohibited"
22179,2618026,4,ChrisNederland,21/03/2023,"Great quiet place, the police check regularly. Had no problems."
22179,2612010,3,surfisupp,16/03/2023,"Guardia Civil confirmed parking is free and let me spend the night next to their station to be safe (right next to this place).
Otherwise seemed like a nice and calm place for a night."
22179,2504608,2,Rockenaufsocken,24/11/2022,During the week it is relatively quiet. Several nights without problems. On weekends I wouldn't recommend lots of people partying all night.
22179,2384383,4,JorgeBriasCobos,18/09/2022,I spent Sunday night. Very calm. In the afternoon the Civil Guard passed by without saying anything. Eye height trees. Me with an L2H2.
22179,1981434,1,Mopark4night,16/06/2022,Closed work in progress
22179,1874432,4,SergeetMalou,07/05/2022,parking near shops less than 5 minutes walk. we have a fairly quiet night there. the Civil Guard came twice and didn't ask us anything. thanks to community.
22179,1866970,1,Sanlucaravan,03/05/2022,"In my opinion not suitable for AC. Low leafy trees, impossible to pass with a Nasturtium. Pavement in poor condition sunken by zones. Frequented by young people to party and a lot of scandal is formed. Better to go to the parking lot in front, just behind the school, although I will also write a review with its particularities."
22179,1744451,3,SarahMH,30/01/2022,Good day time parking but very noisy on Saturday night. Traffic noise and people partying in the car park throughout the night.
22179,1742204,4,7g7g,27/01/2022,great spot but be aware where you park. the tree branches are low and in the morning cars had blocked the route where the branches were high. scraped through! castle is well worth a visit
22179,1741003,5,volitans,25/01/2022,"We just spent a peaceful, quiet night here. The road had quite some traffic until 11pm and again from 7am but during the night it was very quiet. We walked a couple of minutes into town and enjoyed a delicious breakfast at bar Pastor on the main square. It was run by the cutest old couple who prepared everything fresh for us. Highly recommended! 5g coverage for those needing to do van office."
22179,1696954,5,mhmadinina,24/11/2021,Perfect for visiting the village. The view from the castle over the natural park is magnificent! Quiet on a Wednesday in November.
22179,1671223,5,vincentclarisse,31/10/2021,"Small stop for the perfect lunchtime. A location under a large tree which allowed us to eat outside while it was raining lightly. Above all, do not go further in a van, the roads are narrow and difficult to move forward. Impossible to go to the castle in L2H2."
22179,1174168,3,gjplaisier,15/04/2021,The place is fine hence the three stars. At approximately 5:00 PM the square starts to fill up with cars and young people. Lots of loud music. We have decided to go to another place in Jimena. Only 200m. beyond.
22179,1155728,3,mara78,22/03/2021,"We were in November, we had a quiet night."
22179,1105754,2,Silvona,25/10/2020,"Parking very well located to start the route along the Hozgarganta river and visit the Castle and the town, but at night it is the place of the young bottle, with very loud music in the cars and the occasional spin at 2 and 3 o'clock the morning at full speed. Not recommended for the night. Fridays are prohibited by the flea market."
22179,751019,4,solrrak,07/12/2019,"Good place, central but quiet."
22179,746491,4,miguelmlajara,24/11/2019,"Good parking to visit the town and spend the night. It has level sites. Only parking without services. We spent the weekend and there was no noise from young people during the night, only people who had parked their vehicle. Recommendable."
22179,412991,4,newredon266,09/12/2018,"Good place with some squares in plain and close to everything in the town. Nearby bar where there are churros for the morning. As a regular part, during the weekend during the night, young cars from a bottle are brought to the area during the night."
22179,319131,2,Guyi,07/08/2018,"Flat land with a nice view on the mountain. Garbage cans on the parking and picnic tables. On the other hand, a lot of cars come and go in the parking lot during the night and horns."
22179,255349,5,arlo,19/05/2018,"Location in the center of the village, very quiet at night. Flat terrain. No service. Thank you to the municipality."
22179,125972,4,Tony_Master_,09/04/2017,Safe and quiet place. On Friday mornings it is forbidden to park at the flea market. Few sites on the plane. But normally there are hardly any vehicles parked.
22179,75479,4,willvy,03/06/2016,Good sleeping facilities and there is a place to connect the hose to fill the water tanks. Quite quiet place and well located. Although there is a poster of rules where they warn that it is a place of overnight and not camping.
22179,71760,3,kite_rider,07/05/2016,"Somewhat quiet spot within walking distance to the town square. No services, but you could walk across the street and get water from a fountain (no place to hook up a hose though). Watch out for low hanging branches on the trees in the parking area."

22181,3081841,3,Ribeirom,05/08/2023,"We sleep alone in this location. Quiet night, some barking of dogs in the distance. The grid of gray clogged and almost hidden by dirt and grass. The worst thing is that the cars do not respect the loading and unloading area. Nice walk around the lagoon."
22181,2623750,3,HooLee,25/03/2023,Level spaces shared with cars. Little maintenance at the unloading site and in the environment in general. Nice lagoon and quiet area. The interpretation center is permanently closed.
22181,2448194,4,Carthagooo,17/10/2022,"Emptying the toilet and tapping water is fine. The drain for gray water is unfortunately not maintained and is closed by sand and vegetation. The information center / museum and signage are also in a very dilapidated condition. Furthermore, a great location to stay, walk and enjoy nature. Supermarket at 750mtr."
22181,2302885,4,jjlazo79,26/08/2022,"If you are looking to rest in conditions, this is the place. We spent two nights here totally alone, with no other noise than that of the forest. The first morning (9:00 am), a group of hunters organized the hunt right here, with dogs and fuss, but they left to hunt. The emptying grid is a bit covered by the neglect of the site, but it works. The faucet is push button with medium thread."
22181,2129934,5,ppinero,27/07/2022,"Area at the foot of the lagoons to visit, very quiet, we have spent the night alone, there are no stores nearby."

22181,1388039,5,piguanna,31/07/2021,"The great place to rest. The area is very neglected, the museum and interpretation center closed, we do not know why, a villager told us that the town had had problems ... a shame indeed, since we went there by the ornithological routes The emptying grid was overflowed It is level. In town there is a bakery that makes wonderful pizzas!"
22181,1096771,1,mferame,17/10/2020,"A disappointment, we deliberately moved to the town and our first fake. The drain grate was completely obstructed by parked vehicles. We were able to empty and clean black water but not gray. Nor did we see anywhere the point of electricity that in theory there was. We left for another town after an unsuccessful stop."
22181,1090575,5,EvaRuiz,12/10/2020,Site surrounded by nature. Ideal to disconnect. We will be back for a safe route!
22181,871774,5,xegunde,15/07/2020,Perfect area all services including electricity and very quiet thanks to the town hall

22181,174303,2,tounkayen,14/08/2017,"For tranquility will have to come back. Thank you to the mayor but the place is very popular with locals at this time. Ceaseless comings and goings until the night, 22h. Especially since it is a small parking very quickly full, the cars park on the sites of the motorhomes, on the emptying area. Yet the place is not extraordinary, we hardly see the lake."

22192,3029761,5,MatitiMicka,27/07/2023,"Nice place with shade. Lots of joggers and mountain bikers. Low water pressure. Busy road but calm night. Lots of walking paths nearby. Slept one night. Indeed, a nearby resident likes to blow dust with his machine for at least an hour at 9 p.m."
22192,3011064,1,tiamolona,24/07/2023,"By far the worst place to STAY. It seems that you are on a highway. There are 50 roosters that crow at dawn, not 1, not 2, at least 50!!! And today in particular there was a man with a chainsaw who looked like he was cutting down an entire field of poplars. It's okay to stop, but if you want to get some sleep, don't do it here."
22192,2994286,4,arsmo,20/07/2023,"It has been the third time that we use this area. The basics but very quiet despite being next to the road. Only once have we met two other users. Nearby restaurants, supermarkets etc. Buy, go to one of the restaurants, sleep and continue. Thank you very much Valverde del Camino."
22192,2959751,2,Mofli2020,13/07/2023,"Very low flow rate, the water comes out very hot and white. They tell us that we cannot drink, if this is correct they should put up a sign..."
22192,2713873,3,Tacu,01/05/2023,Just used it to overnight and it was ok. Right beside the road but luckily not much noise. Thanks to the municipality to provide us the space. Did not use services
22192,2695684,4,sk555,25/04/2023,"Great for draining. Low flow tap, you have to press for 6 min to have 10 liters. Otherwise perfect."
22192,2682822,2,chiquitin,20/04/2023,"They park the buses and leave at dawn to work, it is next to the road and it is very noisy. Otherwise it's passable."
22192,2679473,3,JorgeDuarte,18/04/2023,"Nice location, next to the road. Mercadona 5 minutes away. 8 parking spaces. The faucet has a weak flow, it takes 15 minutes for 20l of water, it doesn't have a thread for a hose and it's spring-loaded, you have to press it with your hand the whole time. Just for the faucet I don't give 5 stars. The village is beautiful to visit, with many walks possible."
22192,2672176,5,Gaelbah,15/04/2023,"Correct area to spend the night, quiet at night, without too much noise, although it is next to a parking lot in the town. Perfect for visiting this wonderful town famous for its wonderful country boots, leather work and shoemaking in general, or as a stopover on the way to the Sierra de Huelva. If you like the world of enduro motorcycles it is also your place."
22192,2606883,4,zwoiufftour,12/03/2023,Disposal is very good. Unfortunately fresh water right next to black water disposal.
22192,2594886,5,Rosie1955,01/03/2023,"Lovely Aire with full facilities, maximum 48 hours, definitely not suitable for very large motorhomes. Thank you to the local community. Please leave the area clean and tidy."
22192,2564863,2,vejemiju,31/01/2023,"very slow water flow, 1 hour for 80 liters...unsuitable black water drain. better than nothing, but if there is a nearby station offering water better to save time. Thank you anyway to the municipality."
22192,2564542,3,Hollafuchs,30/01/2023,"Nice that there are many such free courses in Spain. But why do so many of them have to be right on busy roads? We don't just want to park, we also want to sleep. We don't recommend it as a place to stay."
22192,2545160,3,claudy02,07/01/2023,Too bad too close to the road for me. Thank you to the municipality for reserving places like this for us.
22192,2543084,4,monikaireland,05/01/2023,Thank you to this lovely town for this place. Description is correct. Bike paths are near. Town is known for making leather boots. Jan 5 th parade was a nice surprise. Ended up staying two nights

22192,2465317,3,nomadazaca,27/10/2022,"A good area, the beautiful town, the only downside is that it is a bit noisy due to the proximity of the road, even so, thanks to the city council for taking us into account."
22192,2460212,4,SandraM.Jerez,24/10/2022,"Area near the town, with free emptying and filling. Next to a park. Ideal for visiting the Rio Tinto Mines. Very quiet place."
22192,2456988,2,Rolo1,22/10/2022,"Stayed here overnight. Emptying ok, getting water a bit difficult, no threads. a lot of traffic so a lot of noise all night a little but from early in the morning a lot of traffic."
22192,2418942,4,dlssantos,02/10/2022,"We called the police because we were going with a caravan and they told us that we could still use the area and they told us that if it was full we could use the clearing next to the area, very well equipped, a bit noisy, which was logical since we were in the path of the entrance of the town, the only thing missing is to have electricity after payment of course, if they could put meters with payment by card it would be wonderful"
22192,2355978,4,Piruleta2021,09/09/2022,"The site is fine. Tap socket without thread, essential rubber adapter. The water flow is very slow (100L = approx 15 min pressing the button). But thanking that it is free!"

22192,2130906,4,Elcanario,27/07/2022,"Great area, I've been two nights and super good and cool, good restaurant near the area with excellent food."
22192,1938456,3,Aloys52686,02/06/2022,"Nice place, but on this busy road you have a lot of traffic (the night goes well). You can tap water, but the trickle is not much. Nice toilets at the Mercadona. You don't even have to go into the store. At 300 m."
22192,1896325,4,Josemigueltomas,17/05/2022,"Thanks to the city council for maintaining this area at the entrance of the town, I take a star away from it because the noise of the vehicles, the entrance road to the town, passes by"
22192,1888090,4,alexischnauzer,13/05/2022,"Good place to rest and quiet, only the noise of a car."
22192,1877573,4,javi4x4,08/05/2022,"Quiet area at the entrance of the town, we only stopped to eat and use the services, the water with little force but well, in general quite well, we did not sleep."
22192,1860383,4,Sin.deentrega,29/04/2022,"Nothing more to say that hasn't been said. Be careful when parking, small spaces, as it fills up you don't leave. Thanks to the municipality of Valverde del Camino."
22192,1848797,5,maixu,23/04/2022,very good free area with all services including electricity. next to the museum of the wise men. we had a very quiet night.
22192,1827968,3,Ma.Eugenia,16/04/2022,"Area located next to a road with a lot of traffic, which makes it noisy. Quite a good location in relation to the town that can be reached on foot in a walk of about 10 minutes. The tap for filling the water has very little power, so it takes a long time to fill the tank in the middle. Even so, we must be grateful for the existence of these areas."
22192,1818979,4,webtarifa,13/04/2022,"Good area well located and with the necessary services. The led faucet has no thread and the pressure is that of a cat's piss. It is next to the entrance road to Valverde del Camino, car noise at night."
22192,1811017,2,davez,08/04/2022,Air well located do not hesitate to visit the church (even if religion does not speak to you) it is magnificent! Small flat the passage of cars on the road
22192,1805563,3,alain1979,03/04/2022,"The city council is thanked, but with some detail it can be improved, for example putting a threaded tap. It is close to the center, next to the road, which can generate noise. But many thanks to the council. Easy emptying of water."
22192,1785405,3,cuevadefernando,16/03/2022,"Grateful to the town hall, but there is room for improvement, very close to the road, the water with little pressure and the delimited spaces too small, at least for an ac of 7.40"
22192,1783679,5,jordibella,15/03/2022,"Good place for everything, but there are few squares, at 7:30 workers gather who make the parking lot next door serve as a meeting point, they are picked up by a van and they are a bit scandalous, the rest is fine, the house of the ungles."
22192,1775345,3,marielcaramel,06/03/2022,"Ok for an emergency place. But it is directly at the road which is the entrance to the town. So it starts to get quite load in the early morning. We didn't sleep well.  The faucet for fresh water isn't threaded, so it is hard to connect a hose."
22192,1770205,3,gwhorgan,01/03/2022,"Good for accessing services. Stayed here one Saturday night in late February. Loud music from club down the street; when it closed, the clientele thought it was fun to drive by the aire and blow their car horns. Perhaps it's quiet on week nights; I didn't stick around to find out."
22192,1753271,4,distritocamper,11/02/2022,Comfortable place to empty water and fill; although the water intake is complicated and the pressure is weak; however it does its job. We spent two nights there during the week and it was very quiet. It is next to the road and some cars can be heard as well as dogs barking and some roosters; but they were not a bother. It is also close to supermarkets and the town center is nice.
22192,1751647,2,rafaydana,09/02/2022,Parking adapted for area. Adjacent to the road that makes it noisy. Complicated taking to fill with water since the tap does not have a thread. It just does its job. It is recommended to visit Casa Dirección which is right next door; Aurora is very nice and does a free guided tour. Thanks to the city.
22192,1745138,3,ASD2021,31/01/2022,"Comfortable place with large and well-defined spaces, it is close to the road but we rested well. The water filling tap does not have an adapter for hoses."

22192,1719256,4,zasyzas,29/12/2021,"Comfortable place, although close to the road, all the basic services, (water). The town is friendly and has everyone. Two highly recommended restaurants: La Tahona, very tasty, very good service, great decoration. The other restaurant is a Michelin star, Casa Address. The two restaurants are very close to the overnight area."
22192,1709825,2,raskatran,14/12/2021,"The water cannot be filled with a tank, with push button and without thread."
22192,1706501,4,quarz16,08/12/2021,Area on the outskirts of town with outlet for water loading and emptying of black and gray. There is traffic at night on the next road but you sleep perfectly. We spent one night and there were 6 more motorhomes. The site is paved and very close to the Mercadona.

22192,1642067,4,KaneloAntonio,13/10/2021,Good area passes a very close road but you can sleep it has all the loading and unloading services. Thanks to the City Council for such a good reception.
22192,1629706,4,Come2021,06/10/2021,"Municipal AC area. I have stopped to eat, there is shade on one side and a source of water without pressure. About 14 seats. Sewage drainage. Next to a restaurant Casa Address. An old mining railway line passes through here. I think it is a bit noisy to sleep, due to the proximity of the road. Continuous."
22192,1397883,2,amaiasandua,03/08/2021,"Good looking area for overnight stay, next to the road, can only be emptied, no water."
22192,1355426,4,AnaNso,23/07/2021,Comfortable and very close to the town with restaurants and supermarkets ... We don't use water so I don't know how that service worked. Very close to a road where many trucks circulate.

22192,1213536,3,Perdi2xelmundo,23/05/2021,"Good place to spend the night, quiet night despite being Saturday. Bad place to refill water. As they say in previous comments, water without any pressure, impossible to fill the tank or a quarter. drain gray and black, no problem."
22192,1192885,3,jcsgalvez,11/05/2021,The water is still low pressure. We hope they improve this aspect since the area is quiet and encourages you to make a stop in this beautiful town and have a few beers in its splendid Town Hall square.
22192,1174211,2,amilpin080,15/04/2021,"There is no pressure in the water, you can spend 40 'to fill. It is appreciated to have areas, and more free, but it is necessary to maintain them. I know that the people there are working on it so that they can improve the area soon."
22192,1166575,4,francou46,04/04/2021,"Small quiet area, it's true a little patience to fill with water but has the merit of existing. Thanks to the town."
22192,1160435,2,Luzindel,29/03/2021,"The City Council is very grateful for having created this area but unfortunately, the clean water filling is faulty, it does not adapt correctly to the hoses and it does not have power. It's a shame, because the village is nice and the environment is very good for hiking."
22192,1132155,1,eTractionTheTrip,21/01/2021,"Place sosolala, dumping yes, but fresh water available, but pressure head, hardly any pressure, little flow, more of a trickle ... We continued without filling."

22192,966181,4,calichy,15/08/2020,"Quiet area. We have spent a night alone. The bar was a bit audible but it didn't bother to sleep. There are garbage cans, a fountain and for sewage."
22192,866999,3,willvy,13/07/2020,As a motorhome area it is fine. The bad thing is that city buses use the motorhome parking area to park. Let's see what will happen when someone arrives and has no parking space.
22192,842428,3,farrukgass,30/06/2020,"Quiet area at night, during the day too many cars pass. Discharge water very well, bad water load, hopefully the municipalities take note of these areas."
22192,790316,4,Ludisen,03/03/2020,"Attached to the road but at dawn it is quiet, little traveled. Water is lacking to load but has black and gray emptying. I wish all the towns had a small area like this."

22192,751891,3,rimorsailer,09/12/2019,"Currently, if there is water in the area, it can continue to empty and fill. The only drawback is the noise of cars and motorcycles because it is on the side of the road"

22192,211831,4,IPalma,19/11/2017,"It is at the exit of the town. In general, well, I wish all the towns had, at least, a place like that. It is true that the water supply is complicated. Near the parking there are exits of hiking trails."
22192,207633,4,vejeriego,30/10/2017,"Good place to park and visit the town, this asphalt and flat with little slope. You can empty and load water. It is close to the road but does not bother much noise to sleep. recommendable bar the terrace to eat."

22192,113261,3,FernandoMarbella,03/11/2016,It is attached to a noisy road. The water intake is a drinking fountain without hose threads and with very little force that makes filling eternal. Otherwise all right.
22192,71227,4,Rogerdeflor,04/05/2016,Emptying gray and black water. The source has little flow and does not have a hose outlet. There is a Mercadona supermarket 30 meters away. Ideal to know the town and make the Greenway.

22192,55268,2,eeae,18/09/2015,"The drain of sewage does not have water what makes the place unhealthy and the drinking water comes from a source that does not serve to load water with hose, if it serves so that they catch water the small farmers who have their garden in the proximities. The parking lot is next to the road and there is a lot of noise throughout the night. The parking is not respected only for motorhomes, in our stay they parked cars and buses, in spite of having parking next to it. The city council has to worry more about this area if it wants visits to the city by the motorhomes. ATTENTION ! The indicated services of: bread, wc and laundry, are not in the area, they are in the town, about 10 minutes on foot."

22197,2316065,1,Sandalias,29/08/2022,"A nightmare. There are 2 spaces in a car park surrounded by residential buildings, without any privacy or charm. Unbearable noise, it makes some echoes and you can hear the voices from the bar on the corner until 2 in the morning, you can hear the trucks and cars accelerating down a long straight line next to the square that already takes you out of town... the worst areas I have been to I DO NOT RECOMMEND."

22201,3028994,5,MartinFidel,27/07/2023,Simply spectacular.
22201,2970135,5,Fulgen,16/07/2023,"a very well equipped area, with very easy loading and unloading. Overcrowded when we have been, as many motorhomes with long stays comment. a 10 for the people."
22201,2961350,5,Zagal75,14/07/2023,"Great area, with incredible views. It's a pity that they are occupied by fixed motorhomes and the few places that they leave occupied by mattress vans taking out chairs, doing their little things outside and not being a place enabled for them. a pity"
22201,2934105,2,marzar,07/07/2023,"At face value the area looked a nice relaxing place to rest.  However many more than the alloted number looked here to stay for the summer duration 'long stayers '. We used the services, thank you to the municipality.  If those that stay flout the rules and regs then this area could be relinquished."
22201,2928405,5,thierrywilliam,06/07/2023,"Very nice place, sea view."
22201,2913083,5,amfreville,01/07/2023,Area very well placed with a superb view close to the village and the beaches Place to recommend
22201,2905917,5,arratie,29/06/2023,"Good area with sea views, a few meters from the beautiful town with white sand beaches and clear water. We ate at the Akelarre Restaurant: cheap portions, pizzas and hamburgers and with a wonderful waitress, in front of a children's playground. Highly recommended to visit!"
22201,2883411,5,Alonja,23/06/2023,"Simply gorgeous! We stood there super nice right on the sea. To fall asleep and wake up to the sound of the sea. Super idyllic and quiet. Filling up fresh water, draining waste water and emptying the toilet is also possible there free of charge."
22201,2869613,5,jaco_piedras,19/06/2023,"Excellent location. A few meters away we have several coves and beaches. The town is beautiful and has many possibilities for leisure and adventure. Very cool! The only thing that doesn't add up to me is that although the description says that there are 16 spaces, there are only 9 actually identified. The rest is for parking in a slightly level area. Anyway it's worth it. Space for loading and unloading very comfortable."
22201,2820144,5,ducrem,04/06/2023,"Quiet place to spend the night and dawn with wonderful views. It has filling and emptying services, the bad thing is that there are few places enabled to park."

22201,2703952,2,AndreasWiegmann,28/04/2023,"...exactly, a place to delight visitors, especially the look! construction ruins and industry. Grass and sea views are right, that's about it"
22201,2697789,5,kasia141060,26/04/2023,"A beautiful place to stay or just take a break. Great view of the sea, very quiet. In the evening everything is controlled by the police, so be careful! Only stay in the marked places, otherwise you will be fined! The only toilet option is on the sports field, unfortunately in a very bad condition! but it is possible to use it. Everything OK!"

22201,2641742,5,anaman,05/04/2023,"Very nice and quiet place (even when they are working on the soccer field). The views of the sea and the manicured lawn with delimited and numbered squares, with no traffic nearby, are some of the careful details in this free area in San Cibrao. From here there is the possibility of taking walks, routes and mountain biking nearby, see wikiloc and enjoy!"

22201,2609647,4,Charlie0604,14/03/2023,"Wow, what a great view. Thank you for these beautiful places. Only one point deducted because there is a construction site next door at the soccer field and the excavator is still working at 7 p.m. I hope he closes work soon! Unfortunately, it also starts again at 8 o'clock in the morning. But we slept wonderfully with the sound of the sea."
22201,2587199,5,Adri9228,22/02/2023,A bit out of town and super nice. Good installation and water flow. Thanks to the city!

A star deduction because it is unfortunately much too bright at night due to LED spotlights. If you follow the motorhome signs there is no height limit of 3.40, the signs go around the old town centre."
22201,2394287,5,Joserram,22/09/2022,Very good views. Good loading and unloading of water of both types. Very quiet area and controlled by the G. Civil that passes continuously. Any type of shopping less than 5 minutes walk. totally recommended

22201,2331318,5,Didacanis,02/09/2022,"Beautiful village with a great area overlooking the sea and the village. I can understand those who stay longer than allowed because the place really asks you to, but it's one thing to overstay and another to appropriate the area."
22201,2296308,5,Pepin2022,24/08/2022,"Very well equipped area. Much appreciated. I was only passing through to empty, load and shop in town. I quite liked the environment, totally recommended. I will be back."
22201,2292296,3,dudust23,23/08/2022,"Spectacular site, but the 4 stars are due to the problem of ""settled"" and uncontrolled or non-housing vehicles occupying sites. correct services. One I have not stuck to the fence of the soccer field and that's it."
22201,2252113,1,mario1955,16/08/2022,not even a place to park. motorhomes in the same place several days ago.

22201,2250112,5,spons,16/08/2022,Fantastic area. And the restaurant in the cellar very well priced and for takeaway
22201,2247935,3,Madbird,16/08/2022,"Thanks to the town hall for this wonderful area, but we must remember that it is a motorhome area, not an area for cars, caravans or campers, it is a pity that the area is occupied by vehicles that, such as cars or campers, can park in standard spaces, and that the motorhomes that due to their size cannot park anywhere, have to leave, because there are no available spaces."
22201,2243153,3,mc_tinez,15/08/2022,Area with good views but full of people. We only stop to empty and visit the town.
22201,2238005,2,tonipf,14/08/2022,"It is a pity, that being a beautiful spot for motorhomes, we cannot enter because it is occupied by a vehicle that is not approved, such as a residential vehicle. A notice for the town hall...thank you, but we have to put order. Go Step....."
22201,2218640,4,evepal,11/08/2022,"Very nice place with beautiful views, a pity that caravans park and the police that pass by do not tell them anything. I had to have control of days."
22201,2216584,5,Saseali,11/08/2022,"We were lucky to park on the front line, very nice views, a part of the town smells bad when the tide goes out, but it is quiet to spend a night."
22201,2211091,1,maryfele,10/08/2022,incredible to get to the place and places occupied by vans when it exclusively puts motorhomes this as we do not start to claim badly let's go if we have few places for motorhome and on top of that the vans get in badly badly a Berlingo occupying a motorhome space denounces the song
22201,2200426,4,Tanguythierry,08/08/2022,"beautiful view, clean and close to everything. beaches less than 100m. very good restaurant 400 meters away. worth the stop"
22201,2197867,1,KFSchmitz,08/08/2022,"Unfortunately completely blocked by permanent campers. People have packed up their mobile homes, drained the sewage and permanently installed the camping chairs and the grill. Worse than camping. Here you won't find any free space (at least in early August)."
22201,2185306,5,Merisam,06/08/2022,Very pretty... But impossible in August. not 1 free seat in august
22201,2181532,5,rafateleco,05/08/2022,Very good site although difficult to get in line facing the sea.
22201,2168005,5,Jayla,03/08/2022,"Great area. With sea views. Several beaches nearby. correct emptying and filling service. Containers. Family supermarket nearby. A Bodega Restaurant highly recommended for great value for money, try the clams with potatoes. Most of the time you have to wait to get a seat but it is worth it although there are always some that settle for weeks. better to arrive in the morning"
22201,2131238,5,Escalam,27/07/2022,"Clean area and close to the town with all the services you may need, Laundromat, pharmacy, tobacconist, food store and good restaurants with the right price, A Bodega very good, and we will be back"

22201,2092843,5,Mitzyna,19/07/2022,"Super recommended area. We did not spend the night although it seemed like a quiet place to sleep. Well located, very nice place (especially if you can park next to the lawn), easy access and all services."
22201,2092479,5,Paichi,19/07/2022,"Beautiful place, good views if you get good parking. Services running. There are cool routines to do around town. The fsmilia supermarket is very close. There are 2 very small beaches after passing the meadow with the cows where the furry ones can take a bath"

22201,2055379,4,XuanAlonso,10/07/2022,"Nice AC area, with gray and black filling and unloading services, right on the beach, it has 16 very large parking spaces, very well lit, there is a beach with public services 200 meters away, a supermarket 500 meters away. hear the sea. The bad thing is that the whole town smells bad, I don't know if it's because of the sewage treatment plant or some collector. There is a very beautiful route from the area to the lighthouse, passing through several beaches"
22201,2045842,5,ireneacero,07/07/2022,"Super recommended area. It has very good views of the sea and its plots are quite spacious. In addition, in the town square in the afternoon there is a lot of atmosphere, it is a two-minute walk from the area."
22201,2042122,4,RebecaNave,05/07/2022,"Perfect place, clean, green and in front of the sea. The only downside is the wind if you go by camper. The town is attached and has all the services. Showers on the beaches."
22201,2004623,5,Danifu60,23/06/2022,"Highly recommended area both for its wonderful views and for how comfortable and spacious the 10 seats are. Perhaps they fall short in times of greater affluence. All free water change services, as it should be. Very well signposted access. Congratulations to the council and let others take note"

22201,1988578,5,Grotebaas,18/06/2022,"Super place, almost completely straight with a magnificent view. All facilities are correct, showers on the beach, public toilets unfortunately still closed. The town has a very nice pub on one of the beaches, shop nearby, several beaches. There are 10 places, but sometimes there are 30 Vans!! Some residents want to get rid of this top spot. Let's all behave in heaven!!!!"
22201,1974160,3,NuggetKatie,13/06/2022,The course is very flat and every pitch has great views of the sea. water worked. trash can available. Public toilets by the sea were closed. Only three stars because the area/town is really run down/abandoned.

At 300m from the super tasty restaurant ""A Bodega"", fantastic food for a small price, taste everything that comes from the sea. And if you want the ambiance of Galicia, go to ""O Pulgas"", which is a small bar on a beautiful beach. The boss and mistress are really special, you won't regret it."
22201,1711837,5,MintH,18/12/2021,A lovely overnight spot to visit a pretty village. Great coastal walking and back via the narrow gauge railway.
22201,1704101,5,franjgr,05/12/2021,"Area with large and well-defined squares, incredible views and very close to the center and the beaches. The only possible drawback, if the tide is high and there is a storm, you will hear the waves breaking very close"

It is quiet here and you can walk over the rocks along the sea. There are several beautiful beaches in the area. Reasonable 4G connection
22201,1567871,5,jairo,11/09/2021,"Perfect, thanks to San Cibrao for counting on us."

22201,1546716,5,LABOINA,04/09/2021,"Excellent area with the sea in front. The town is very beautiful and quiet, all services and perfect for spending the night since it is quite quiet from 11 a.m. and at 11:30 a patrol comes to monitor if there are problems. A pity that there are few parking spaces that is the only downside."
22201,1545663,5,noranahiN,04/09/2021,"Awesome place !!! Thank you very much to the City Council of San Ciprian! all services and good for recycling. Stunning views that give serenity. Near the town and with good walks. The lighthouse, the port and next to the river. Interesting everything. I really liked the town with its well-prepared beaches. We will be back !! ♥ ️"
22201,1543272,3,mariviytxus,03/09/2021,"It is very cool, but they had to control more, because there are motorhomes that have been parked for many days. When something is free and well located, people tend to huddle, without thinking that they have to leave room for others."

Thanks to the city council for having something like this in their town. We did not spend nights, we only went to see her for future visits at 3:30 p.m. There were 2 Syrians free. the first is shorter as for a van."

22201,1515862,4,IzanSpain300,26/08/2021,It is a very popular place but there is a huge German motorhome that has not moved for 2 months. Unsupportive and cheeky where they exist. Meanwhile the others parking where they can
22201,1514453,4,Tessoros,26/08/2021,"In the afternoon it is impossible to park either in the squares or outside them. We sleep in one of the parking lots in the nearby urbanization. Around half past ten there is movement, we wait in double line and we park in the plaza de ac. Town with a lot of atmosphere and all services."
22201,1502607,4,VALLESCOM,23/08/2021,"Good rest area for us. Few places to park and spend the night and if there is AC on top that they think is a campsite where they can be unemployed for a week, it is impossible for everyone to enjoy it. I say this because of some AC that was there and because of the comments of several people."

Well-kept area with beautiful views by the sea, pleasant walk through the town and its lighthouse and a small coastal excursion to your right. But you also have to know that the nearby environment is very industrial and at some point you will see the ALCOA facilities, its chimneys and the environmental impact of this type of industry. In any case, it will not be difficult to abstract."

22201,980348,3,mcastro,19/08/2020,"It looks like a Romanian camp, there are people here who have been around for a long time, chairs, tables, awnings all taken off, then they say they kick us out of all places, they are too permissive. PLEASE LET US MAKE THINGS RIGHT. I do not recommend it for that matter otherwise good views."

22201,921977,2,thewildlakeys,02/08/2020,Wouldn’t recommend this place during the summer as the camper spaces are very close together and it was completely full when we arrived. There were around 10 motorhomes and pulling up in our scruffy self build everybody just stared at us! If you can get a space and are happy to live very close to others then I guess it’s fine.
22201,917484,5,VeraLis,01/08/2020,"Very cool area, although it has 11 places for the land, it extends a little more and about 6 more enter. Quite a flame and beautiful views, not a noise, just the few waves that hit the rocks."
22201,914361,5,jtrisan339,31/07/2020,"Lovely and very quiet place with very nice views over the coast. Level squares that overlook a flat grassy terrain where we can sit and enjoy the scenery. Several beaches within walking distance, and very close to the center of town. I recommend eating at Mesón A Bodega, two blocks from the area. Exceptional dishes, a cozy place and charming service. You can also have homemade churros for breakfast !!!"
22201,913713,5,ALyMJ,31/07/2020,Great area with spectacular views. With emptying and filling of waters. The water tap sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't.
22201,907431,5,IzanSpain300,28/07/2020,"The place is incredible but watch out for the Bodega restaurant, depending on whether you are a local or you don't get octopus mixing good with hard. The short waitress is an edge. You will be happy with the treatment if you do not touch that edge that literally throws the food at you. It scared us when he tapped the table twice to serve the coffees. That is why we stay in the van. The area is one of the best"
22201,905201,5,Nippers,27/07/2020,"Spectacular! Remember that it is 48 hours only so we could all take advantage of this area. The area is incredible for its location. Theme of beaches, location, waters ... etc ... 10! Even typical COVID-19 gel! Outstanding to the town hall! To Bodega (200 meters from the area) incredible treatment ... impressive portions ... is that they take away the desire to continue traveling!"

22201,845835,4,Mariuge,02/07/2020,"The free area located on the cliffs has magnificent views. This time, there is no water in either of the two taps, both for filling water and for unloading and cleaning the ""cassette"", making it difficult to discharge. At this point in the pandemic, it has to do with lack of maintenance by the City Council"

22201,146378,4,celta,28/06/2017,I am a resident of San Ciprian and one of the promoters of the area. Usually it is enough ... except for the 2nd Saturday of August that coincides with the Feast of A Maruxaina and in those days the town is taken and impassable the same as the area. A point of light has been installed and soon it seems that there will be Wi.fi open I hope they put some signal for those who do not come with gps.
22201,112895,3,logust76,01/11/2016,I confirm that there is everything you need but you just have to look to the sea. The rest of the landscape is not good!
22201,112222,5,nalo,29/10/2016,"Very close to the village, flat, overlooking the lighthouse and illuminated just (little by little, ideal for perboctar). Not asphalted but correct. The 10 sites in the description are correct. I imagine that in summer they will get double and it will be something just to enter and exit (it's dead-end street). The nearby beach has bathrooms. Lots of bars less than 100 m. With all that: highly recommended."

22201,91999,4,stopplay,09/08/2016,"Well but world armored in the month of August, simple and efficient emptying, just misses a threaded tap. City with lots of shops, a very nice grocery store where the boss speaks French (unfortunately I did not note the name) it must be the closest to the area in the street to the left of the cubic architect's house edge beach."
22201,54923,5,dubradol,14/09/2015,"Perfect: reserved area on the beach with all services. Small, quiet and very pretty village. Definitely don't look for another place if you're in the area."

22210,3043276,1,ainacram,30/07/2023,"Come, sleep and leave. The facilities (toilet/shower) are disgusting. The junk which has been reported by previous people staying has been pushed (by the owner or by the wind) to the edges of the site, but is still there so you still feel like you’re in a dump site if you walk under the trees. The owner comes by to pick up her cash and that’s it."
22210,2879416,3,ddleprof,22/06/2023,Convenient to visit Figueres otherwise it leaves something to be desired in terms of cleanliness and above all use a mosquito net otherwise you are quickly invaded by clouds of flies

For us it has been a wonderful place, surrounded by nature, highly recommended, both to spend one night and several days."
22210,1986255,1,lydoli,17/06/2022,"no and no. Large space on grass that's all that's positive. Dirty toilets, showers. the garbage... you have to slalom between the waste and the useless things all around the house. the full of clean water we do it with our pipes while lifting so as not to touch anything. the worst the smell.. with this heat we had a pigsty not far away. 12 euros is expensive for that I do not recommend it"
22210,1953766,5,Ruud58,06/06/2022,"nice quiet place for 10 euros without electricity and 12 euros with electricity nothing wrong with that. ok shower and toilet not our thing but as a motor home you have everything with you. power connections indeed few, but there is always a solution."
22210,1951353,2,UteMeike,06/06/2022,"Actually a nice place to stay if more attention was paid to cleanliness. We didn't use the toilet or shower, nor did we take fresh water. It was too dirty for us."
22210,1894111,5,madridista91,16/05/2022,"I don't understand the comment about it smelling. Everything was good, quiet location, relaxed atmosphere, cozy neighbors and great hostess. What more do you want? There is a restaurant 5min walking distance with good food. Recommended! There was only partial electricity supply, but we found a solution right away because of the nice hostess."
22210,1803260,3,AstridKrueck,01/04/2022,"We have now been there three times for one night each. It's easy and calm, nice to walk with the dogs. Nice operator, very uncomplicated. We have never used the shower or toilet."

We were allowed to stand on the gravel, we were just too heavy for the meadow - it was soggy because of the rain. It was super quiet. We were super happy to be able to spend the very rainy night here!"

We arrived at 4:30 p.m. no more electricity. I won't stay there again I think if the owners did the necessary they could get a much better rating. If you're not too tired I think you have to move on"
22210,1757342,4,petfig,16/02/2022,"A lot of space and therefore also suitable for larger mobile homes. We had a quiet night here despite the adjoining street. Discharge and supply works perfectly. We didn't use the Dixi toilet and shower. Walking paths right from the site, good for dog owners."

Good price. shower and toilet a little run down but water was hot. WiFi was fast and no pauses. Very friendly and helpful lady who speaks English. Going to add this as a favourite.
22210,1729392,5,Aldy,08/01/2022,"A lovely quiet place. And a super friendly welcome! Beautiful village within walking distance! And indeed the plumbing is primitive, but it is there (although we are self-sufficient with the camper, so we didn't use it). You can discharge your gray water and empty the toilet and fill up with clean water, and you are connected to the electricity. What else do you want!"
22210,1729360,2,MarionTorsten,08/01/2022,"A safe place with electricity and WiFi. Shower and toilet cannot be used, as already described, lowest level. You don't want to draw water there either."

22210,1671754,4,Fer-Lau,31/10/2021,"Large grassy terrain, level, next to it there is a road but little traveled, you sleep perfectly. Services included less electricity which are € 2. I don't put more stars because the bathroom and sink area had a flooded floor and a bad smell; if you don't need to use those services, that's great. Lidia very kind, comes to collect and explain how it works. We will be back for sure"
22210,1635453,1,voyage11,09/10/2021,Customers for more than 5 years we have noticed a flagrant degradation. it gets worse and worse and more expensive! No investment no cleaning we will not come back.
22210,1611500,2,Ricardsc,27/09/2021,"It is a green field, unfortunately VERY neglected, if you need a toilet I do not recommend a shower, it is passable to spend one night, I give it two stars because even though the price is low 12e with current and 10e without, they should invest in cleaning and order , and separate the permanent parking of semi-abandoned caravans from which we spend the night."
22210,1595923,2,varvaravan,20/09/2021,It's a basic parking place and careless services.

22210,1415669,2,mosqueta,06/08/2021,"I go by camper and use the common areas (toilet, shower, sink ...). They are very neglected, old, broken, dirty. I do it out of necessity, if I could I would avoid it. If you go with AC or you don't use them, the site is perfect. Advice to owners: take care of these areas and they will fill the large space they have. The location and the price more than perfect, but this makes me not want to return or recommend the place."
22210,1404672,1,nauzazu,04/08/2021,"Positive: very spacious and quiet place. To improve: old and poorly maintained facilities, poor hygiene, no matter how cheap it is, for me as everything is, it is not even worth the € 10 you pay ... If I were more careful and a day I would have paid the € 10 more at ease and I would surely return, but if I can (unless I see that it has changed) I will not return."
22210,1362618,4,SheyLopez,25/07/2021,"Very quiet place with a lot of shade. The facilities are old but the price is quite cheap compared to other ACs. € 10 high season, includes bathroom with shower, light and wifi. Close to two grocery butchers"

22210,1252813,2,mariograca,13/06/2021,"Location ok because near the border, but only suitable for one night and the place needs maintenance and a good tidy up"

22210,1166718,1,pessoa1969,04/04/2021,"The parking lot is fine. The facilities are worth it. (Very sad). The water change zone is atrocious. It has scrap cars, and other things, that you have to avoid carefully, since they are not marked. The danger of scratching the motorhome is latent. It is not a motorhome area. it is a space in their house, for the vans to be parked."
22210,1166273,3,Joanki,04/04/2021,"Large space with grass. Inside the village, it is fine. Water area needs to be improved. Just one sleeve for both filling and cleaning pot."

22210,1143122,3,SylviaNowakowitsch,27/02/2021,The place is really well located. Just. Everything there. Price performance is right. Unfortunately the tower clock struck every 15th minute. Restful sleep was out of the question. What a shame

22210,1110689,3,Mag2cognac,01/11/2020,"Big field. 10 € per night. Electrical connection, old but functional sanitary facilities. Quiet night, we could hear the church bells a little, but little disturbing. On the other hand, not enough electrical connections, suddenly when there are a little too many motorhomes you cannot connect and the price remains the same, in this case we recommend the free parking in the neighboring village peralada."

22210,752790,5,Dunnoir,11/12/2019,Was greeted by friendly owner after we pulled in at 7pm. €10 including electric hook up. Only one shower on site but works as expected. Could have done with a Drinking Water sign to avoid confusion though

22210,697054,3,Lobo15,19/09/2019,"Great place which is also suitable for large mobile. Shower and toilet are getting old. Disposal behind the house is a little difficult to drive for large mobile. You need a hose to hit the sewer. Otherwise, well suited for a stopover."

The people who take this we absolutely nothing to do with you, except yelling all day (they speak very loud, especially the blonde), mower every two days ... as I said it saw better for calm. No hot water for the dishes either. Oh yes, there are fleas too. To avoid if you have an untreated dog. In short we were attracted by the price and this is the only thing that is worth it. When I think of the money that must be made, a lil renovation of the toilets would not be refused. And the wifi does not work either, when I ask her she says ""I do not know"" ..."

The natural park of Cap Creus and the sea not far away either. Home really nice, the young lady who takes care of everything is very helpful. € 10 with electricity, wifi and services. We love to stop there (the big trees on the outskirts of this large meadow protect strong winds, Without disturbing the satellite reception, a detail certainly but that may be important for some travelers)."

22210,404570,3,Smayu,04/11/2018,Large and quiet area. We spent 2 nights and with total peace of mind. For the price you have the light and WiFi that goes very well. The other services are somewhat just because there is only one bathroom with a shower and a sink for washing dishes. For 10 euros perfect.

However, for bigger motorhomes/RVs I’d recommend you approach from the south and don’t try to get through the village of Cabanes which is very narrow and has a couple of really tight turns. For just €10 per night including electricity how can anyone complain? Quiet site, lovely owner.  No silly extras for kids/dogs etc. Wifi works well."
22210,276448,3,Fiorenza88,28/06/2018,"Dilapidated structure, worse bathroom than public chemical toilets. However, for AA and CS and a calm and safe stop I do not complain about spending € 10. Figures at 5 minutes by bike."

At night, sometimes very restless due to the railroad that drives right past the parking lot, but also by people who have to “step on the gas” with a grin. Unfortunately very dirty, a lot of garbage around the parking lot. There is a Mc Donalds nearby, many young people get something there, then park themselves here, eat with the engine running and throw the garbage out of the window. It's a pity! The view is great, Ponferrado itself has nothing to offer except the castle, terrible city. But if you need electricity you unfortunately have no choice in the area and the place is ok. You can also get gas at the petrol station, the supermarket in the petrol station is very cheap. Nearby is a supermarket ""Mercadona"".

We were guided to a place that was obviously too small. The only solution offered was to spend the night at the entrance and wait until the next day to see if another motorhome leaves while specifying that the campsite is very full in August"

Well organised with areas allocated for small tents, larger tents and vans.  Best of all is the great, quiet and respectful atmosphere on site.  No long-term campers, great mix of nationalities.  Basketball hoops, beach volleyball all on site."

22236,2935279,4,ilonabernhardt,07/07/2023,it is a very nice green campsite. sanitary nice and clean and staff very. friendly. I thought it was a pity that you had to pay separately for the swimming pool (you). it's not nice to have to think about that. then raise the price slightly so that you don't have to do this with a cumbersome card and wristband system.
22236,2911679,5,Grabo,01/07/2023,"Probably the best site we have stayed at in 6 weeks in Portugal and Spain. Lovely location in pine woods overlooking a lake with nice randomly spaced pitches you can choose yourself. Bar, restaurant and small shop on site. The facilities are excellent - clean with toilet paper, seats and hot water for washing up. You can rent various boats and quad bike tours which although expensive are worth it"

In short, to recommend!"

Hikes are possible from the campsite, but mainly on relatively busy roads without sidewalks. A star deduction because despite a price of 26 € (2 p. mobile home electricity) the small pool still costs extra entry."
22236,2836044,5,NualaandSeamus,09/06/2023,"This is our sort of campsite. The feel of being alone in the wild yet with all the luxuries of a campsite.
Staff were extremely helpful with information on services on site, hikes and sights in the area. We were allowed to select our own pitch which had fabulous views down onto the river. Extremely quiet except for birdsong. Beautiful place can't recommend it enough. We will definitely be back."

It's a nice campground with lots of trees and a good setup, located at a lake. Stunning region, quite wild and beautiful and great for hiking. Staff were very friendly and bathrooms clean, though very cold due to all the windows open. We can definitely recommend the place and would like to come back one day."
22236,2508856,5,jdgraaf,29/11/2022,"We loved this place, especially its surroundings around and in the lake. The terraces on the camping site around the hill gives this place a nice atmosphere.

Many new pitches have been added, but nature still comes first. Simply one of the most beautiful courses in Portugal and at an unbeatable price."

Great facilities and very clean showers and toilets. Friendly English speaking staff, we also had something delivered to the campsite which wasn’t a problem. They have a new little pool made of recycled shipping containers which we enjoyed too. Fully recommend this place."
22236,2408937,5,hanne1995,28/09/2022,Absolutely loved this camping! We had a beautiful camping spot overlooking the river. The people are very friendly and gave us some information about the area (hiking to the lagoons was really amazing)! The bathrooms (women) were vert clean and big. Definitely recommend!
22236,2391594,5,mawui79,21/09/2022,"We confirm the other opinions, wonderful camping in a privileged place. Very clean and well-maintained facilities, very attentive and friendly staff, a good place to practice mountain sports that can be hired at the campsite itself. The only negative point is that access to the pool has to be paid, €5 a day or €3 half a day. Apart from this highly recommended."
22236,2379276,4,GGTravel11,17/09/2022,"Nice area to stay overnight, friendly staff. Restaurant sells tasty snacks. The sanitary facilities were neat, but disturbing that there were only taps with a push button (at sinks, showers and even at the washing up area). At night a lot of awake by barking dogs in the neighborhood."

22236,2238056,4,raulalonso,14/08/2022,"The place is magical. The nature around the campsite could not be better, rivers for paddling or swimming and fantastic trails for mountain biking. The 5 star service. Friendly and attentive staff. Clean bathrooms. The downside is that the campervan area is not well delimited and there is a lot of dust. Anyway, putting everything in the balance, I would come back without a doubt."
22236,2235486,4,SofiaBotas,14/08/2022,"Beautiful park between the Froufe and Tamente rivers, not the Lima river as the description says. There are waterfalls nearby that we can visit on foot. Nice people. But for one night, a van, 2 adults and 2 kids, we paid 34 euros. The distribution of vans and tents is a little messy. For the price and lack of space, we give it 4*."
22236,2187425,5,mickeygti,06/08/2022,"Welcoming and friendly, clean, location rather free. Small bar with snack. Close to bathing 3 mins walk to the dam or 6 kms river with natural pools and waterfall (ermida). As a result, the campsite's mini swimming pool is not essential."
22236,2185904,1,susfab,06/08/2022,Plots without signage and some very far from the electrical outlet that they charge you separately. Cost 2 adults and a dog with electricity one night 30 euros
22236,2182014,4,UweHeuer,06/08/2022,We stayed 3 nights with our Motorhome. Sites are not assigned but can be selected. Some sites have more shade than others and the sizes and levels are different. Restaurant is ok but often full. There is a better one in the village across the main street. If you want to rent a canoe be close to 10 at the reception. You can also walk up the Rio Tamente starting at the old bridge in the village.

22236,2126082,4,gaelleleh,26/07/2022,"Cool camping, we choose our pitch in the “autocaravanas” zone, 31 euros per night for 4 in a van (not expensive at all for camping!). You have to leave the campsite to go to the water (5 min walk to the pontoon, you can go further too), perfect river for SUP. Much better than the tiny swimming pool, which is not included in the price"

You are very close to each other. Annoying the multiple occupancy by cars of the caravan owners. In the morning we had to wait until the reception opened to leave the place. Sanitary good, as well as the friendliness of the staff."

We paid €18 for 1 night with 1 van and 2 people. Wifi was unfortunately only available at the bar on site. You also need a long cable for electricity.

22236,1546592,5,Newa,04/09/2021,"Nice campsite in the woods. Unfortunately there is no direct access to the river, but within a few meters walking distance. Nice bar / cafe. Very quiet at night. The sanitary facilities were very large and clean. A great hiking route starts in the next village. Paid € 18 for two adults and a van."
22236,1493153,5,justineopreis,21/08/2021,"Although it is the busiest time, August and weekend, there is plenty of room. super chill here"
22236,1444518,1,teeloo,12/08/2021,Ok so this is written in August during pandemic time. Camping is potentially wonderful. But be aware of groups tenting that might stay and bring along a guitar and play the WHOLE day as if no one is around. I guess some people think a camping equals to a festival ground. So what’s the aftertaste? Hippie campground where kids may scream along and groupies are more then welcome.
22236,1427928,5,karlmags,09/08/2021,Super nice natural campsite. Highly recommended :)
22236,1372871,5,MarianaFreitas,28/07/2021,"Excellent, we love the park. very friendly staff clean bathrooms have a mini market with essentials and it is possible to order bread for the next day"

Hiking and kayaking around,  cheap food and good wine. Better to arrive before 10 pm but if later you can sleep at the entrance."

22236,1277437,4,EsthervdAa,26/06/2021,The campsite is beautifully laid out and the toilet building also looks neat. Too bad the showers were lukewarm. From the campsite you can go to beautiful waterfalls.
22236,1271467,5,lespepesvanlifers,23/06/2021,"Perfect place to take a break and take a hot shower. For restaurant meals, count an average of 4 to 5th meals. Presence of a lot of activity (kayak, paddle, buggy ...) we paid 15 € for 2 person and our doggie (in van). Possibility to connect for 3.50 € more."
22236,1253099,5,Anikanski,13/06/2021,"One of the best campings we have been too. Everything beautiful, clean and nice atmosphere. Price is very good considering what you get (14 euro for 1 camper and 2 persons, all service included with adac discount). The restaurant serves really good food for decent prices. Plus: very good location!"

22236,1231809,5,SoniaLiz,02/06/2021,Park very well located beside the river. All super friendly and helpful staff. Proof that it is possible to have a park well inserted in the natural space.
22236,1191695,5,eidechsen,10/05/2021,"Great place, a little paradise, wonderful nature, you can hear the street a little bit, but you can clearly hear the birdsong in the foreground. The staff is incredibly nice and helpful, the area is a dream. Great hiking trails through the mountains or along the river. We'll be back someday."
22236,1109565,5,Regina65,30/10/2020,"Super nice campsite. I was here in October and it was very quiet. Absolutely relaxed and only 2 other motorhomes. The campsite is very nicely located in the forest and the upper places have a view of the Lima. Supply and disposal station very clean, as well as the sanitary facilities. The staff was super friendly and you could order fresh bread every morning."
22236,1057363,4,Rafabi,19/09/2020,"Nice, quiet campsite with clean sanitary facilities and nice staff. Some of the best pitches for long-term campers are reserved for campers, but the front ones still have a great view through the trees of the river. Also very inexpensive, with an ADAC card € 28 for two nights with electricity."
22236,1032679,4,Naturuchi,07/09/2020,Spectacular campsite with various activities to do outdoors. It is located next to the river so the views are magnificent. The campsite has barbecues and even tables to eat.

22236,975467,3,ViNeko,17/08/2020,"Location with somewhat difficult access. Excellent changing rooms. Service area for motorhomes with bad access! Access to the dam through the emergency exit gate should be accessible to all Camping users. Something expensive considering the quality / price ratio in high season. They make negative discrimination in relation to the size of the motorhomes, the occupation of a parcel is irrelevant ..."
22236,884798,5,ym58,20/07/2020,"I confirm the previous opinions except those deploring the noise and / or the prices ... even in the middle of July, we were quiet all night and paid some 22 € for 2 people and a 5m40 van, with the 'electricity ! The campsite is large and very well organized. The tri-lingual reception is professional and the indications clear and precise. The well-demarcated internal areas allow to maintain appreciable separations between the different types of campers (caravans, vans or tents) and there are even a few bungalows and yurts on stilts which we looked like very well finished overlooking the river- lake bordering the campsite (the dam is not very far downstream). It's good to have shims but if you are an expert in spirit level, you can get by without! The pine forest provides plenty of shade while letting the sun filter out (thank you for the solar panels and drying the laundry!). Two ""refreshing"" outings well marked on a map at the campsite reception allow you to go to two torrents (lagoons) just next door (800m and 1800m): not useless during the summer months! The bar is well run and very affordable: € 4 for a café au lait, a beer and a port! The wifi is available at the reception and at the bar but a little weak because ADSL only. Large and very clean toilets with hot water, washing machine and dryer (coin operated). In short, a well-kept and affordable campsite in the heart of Minho country, where you feel at home (it speaks English and French almost everywhere!) Do not hesitate to visit Ponte de Lima less than 20 km away, especially every other Monday -> HUGE all-produce market frequented by all Portuguese in the region from 7:30 am."
22236,784717,5,Laercio,22/02/2020,One of the best camping sites I have been in Portugal!

However be warned if coming from the North the navigation takes you on a really obscure off road track - I had to uturn and find an alternative route. Road is very bumpy to caution needed.

Thank you for picking up your waste. There is the possibility of renting a pedal boat, it's very nice (10 € for 1 hour for 2 people). There is no toilet. There is a lot of traffic until the evening and then early in the morning."

22442,1233532,5,zapatillaroja,03/06/2021,"Perfect for camping and allowed to stay overnight. Several flat areas around the lake, it is something to look for. Better further from the beach bars if you prefer to hear only the birds and frogs. It has streetlights along the pedestrian path all night, so the area is illuminated to arrive at night without problem. It is Pista until you reach the camping areas. Very easy access with AC. Find shade between trees so you don't roast in the morning. There are many garbage cans, so there is no excuse to make it even cleaner. There are no services for AC. Beautiful views. A lovely site."

22442,1028868,3,c.agor,06/09/2020,"The place is very good to sleep, as long as there are no ""families"" who, with the restrictions of pubs due to the covid situation, come to this area to do ""dinner / bottle"". That's not bad as long as they collected their garbage and left the area clean as they found it. I recommend coming during the week or spending the night in the westernmost area."

22544,740494,4,donpedro66,09/11/2019,"The parking has been concreted, it offers a nice parking area, a bit sloping. This disadvantage is easily compensated by a slight wedging or by parking slightly at an angle. Very quiet at night."

There we spent a quiet night and did not disturb the market. The market on Friday is very large, spread over different squares. You can get everything and many locals come to shop.

22615,1438649,3,Leugims,11/08/2021,"Place with some shade next to the municipal garden of Trancoso. This car park is quite large, it is at the foot of the city walls for a visit, but you have to bear in mind that this park is the fairground and can be busy at times.

22617,2736124,1,StephMiCote,09/05/2023,"A HORROR. Our cc is over 6m, we were taken like a bus. 5 min ride in the parking lot which cost us 40€ and if more we would have had to pay 80€. It's clearly theft, what a shame"
22617,2719313,1,crantoine,03/05/2023,"Parking at the single rate of 20 euros for vehicles over 1.75m ..... even at the manual cash desk they didn't want to know. for 3 hours in the parking lot, c flight limit."
22617,2717295,1,phrd,02/05/2023,PLEASE NOTE: the site is now controlled access from 2kms before and you cannot enter if there is no free space. And that's impossible for a large motorhome...
22617,2713743,4,CattinJ,01/05/2023,"€20 for 24 hours was worth paying for us because we knew we could leave the van all day and it was safe. By 10am on a Sunday all the places had gone so arrive early on weekends/ holidays.
Not flat but very quiet at night. Fabulous views. Cafes and toilets available. Good location for walks, visiting the museum & monestary. Manual payment on exit."
22617,2695733,5,Doc55,25/04/2023,"Ideal place to stay. You have to pay the 20 euros for the Womo anyway when you come and park in the day parking lot. After consultation with the security you can stay until 8 a.m. and then pay the staff at the exit, not at the machine. Montserrat is a must and best way to the top, walk or take the train And there are toilets and rubbish bins."
22617,2637383,3,BelaPetra,03/04/2023,"Of course it's awesome at the top, but it's a parking lot. All places are pretty slanted. At night I was in the bus parking lot, that's where it is. I went down the mountain very early in the morning (5:30) because it was too windy for me. The barrier was open."
22617,2634605,5,blaues_reh,02/04/2023,We stood a little below the bus parking lot with some other campers. Very good view. The toilet in the monastery complex above was also open late in the evening (probably around the clock). At the parking machine it is clearly pointed out that you should only pay at the exit at the house. We paid 20 euros for one night.
22617,2612830,3,camperknuti,17/03/2023,"Attention, do not pay for the parking ticket at the machine, but take it at the Spur Manual exit and pay 20 € to the cashier at the ticket office. At the machine, 80 € will be charged as a bus."
22617,2576042,5,williheinrich,12/02/2023,The sunrise from there is definitely worth the €20 parking fee.
22617,2543566,5,wideglide298,06/01/2023,"Mega parking space, with a sensational view. Motorhome costs €20 for 1 day. If you stay 3 days it costs 25€ for 3 days. In the evening from about 6:00 p.m. you can park in the bus parking lot. There you have a fantastic view and the surfaces are flat. During the day you have to park a few meters further down, there are several double bays. Be sure to pay at the ticket booth at the barrier."
22617,2524523,2,InigoIba,19/12/2022,"Good place but very expensive if you are not going to be there for a long time... after 30 min they charge you the van rate of €20. It is worth parking outside the barrier and approaching on foot, the walk is worth it."
22617,2509457,3,jipsouil,30/11/2022,"the place is magnificent, sumptuous both in view and inside the abbey. too bad that motorhomes are taxed at €20 when no special parking is provided. a car is 6€50..."
22617,2481069,4,miquelpc,03/11/2022,"A very good place in the bus parking lot, quite flat from 8:30 p.m. to 7:45 a.m., then you go down a little further down and leave it in a double parking lot. It costs €20 for a motorhome."
22617,2467575,4,koalakimberley,28/10/2022,"This is the bus parking lot. We can therefore settle there from 6 p.m. to 8:30 a.m. Afterwards, park the motorhome lower (a second small platform, a bus turnaround area, is not too steep). Great to sleep up there facing this magnificent landscape."
22617,2348442,5,Chan043,07/09/2022,"Excellent place to stay overnight. park on regular space during the day, and after 18h you can move to the bus parking. Its allowed by the controllers.
Manual payment of €20 on your way out.

Wonderful awakening with sunrise. Great early morning hike when it is still empty. Get there early evening g to visit the cathedral etc and go for home in the morning. Well worth the €20!"
22617,2338396,4,IrisSala,04/09/2022,Extraordinary views. Calm down. Ideal for hiking or visits to the Sanctuary
22617,2244486,4,alrisan,15/08/2022,"It is worth it, incredible night views, and a very pleasant visit the next day walking through its streets. You can access the car park with vehicles over 3m high without any problem, you pay manually at the checkout at the exit, and it costs €20. We slept the night of 08/01, and the bus parking was closed, but there was room a little further down, somewhat inclined, but putting chocks, no problem."
22617,2200526,4,alainpel,08/08/2022,"the car park mentioned above is reserved for buses but you can park several hundred meters before. large motorhomes can exceed pitches, there are a few places where a 6m or 6.5m can be parked without exceeding. Either way, a great site. 20€ for 24h, slightly sloping. Pay the 20€ to the caretaker at the exit, otherwise 80 at the automatic cash desks"
22617,1804371,1,reisefreak1,02/04/2022,"Corrections: 1. It is a bus parking lot where campers are allowed to stay overnight AFTER the buses have left (approx. 6 p.m.). 2. That costs €20/24h, ""without anything"". 3. This is the P at the MOUNTAIN STATION, at an altitude of approx. 900 m, drafty and the most violent gusts of fall."
22617,1785191,3,sloopy1,16/03/2022,"I find the price a bit outrageous. The first half hour is free, after 30 minutes it costs €20. Whether you stand for 31 minutes or 24 hours. So we paid €20 for 2 hours. I find that really intense."
22617,1780213,4,campybrown,11/03/2022,"Price for overnight stay was 20 euros which included access to the monastery area, basilica and museum - good value for 2 people for an overnight stop and the views were amazing. Pay at the ticket booth by the exit rather than at the machines to ensure you are charged correctly."
22617,1765271,3,raksope,25/02/2022,"A consideration to take into account. We slept on Saturday night and the parking lot was surprisingly quite full. The problem came the next day when it started to fill up and after saying several times not to park in places not allowed that we couldn't leave, we had to leave in a hurry or in the end it was a continuous discussion. Easy to get locked up."
22617,1729935,3,Boch51,08/01/2022,We didn't go since a camping car is longer considerated as a car and it's 20 euros... It seems really pretty but we didn't feel it worth it.
22617,1727183,4,CortenRudy,05/01/2022,"ideal for a visit to Monestria and surrounding hiking possibilities, the rate campincar on January 4, 2022 was 20 euros for 24 hours. Pay attention best to pay at exit MANUAL, the automatic cash registers wanted us to pay 80 euros (= bus fare). No water or electro but guaranteed unforgettable stay and visit"

22617,1600979,5,Serelcambio,23/09/2021,"We stayed 3 nights for 17 euros in the parking lot. It is steep but they let you put levelers. The nights are calm and the views are incredible. 24 hour service. The monastery is incredible, but nothing compares to the mountain of needles, in a jagged shape, with carved animals behind it. Its multiple paths and ways of traveling make it perfect for all tastes and ages."
22617,1571885,5,park4night4tnt,12/09/2021,"We stood here for one night and it was very pleasant. The toilets at the bus parking lot are only open on weekends, the toilets in the monastery complex all night. The very nice security staff advised us to pay at the ticket booth. The background to this is an automatic height measurement at the entrance barrier, which a motorhome otherwise bills as a bus"
22617,1259068,5,ALX667,16/06/2021,"The pictures don't do the place justice. Unbelievable foresight on a clear day - at least 200km. Lovely view. Great sunriser. In addition, the monastery comes with the hiking trails around it. You can easily spend several days here. Pay at the exit - not at the machine!"
22617,1206842,2,Robuga,19/05/2021,"Very expensive!!!! My motorhome measures 7 and a half meters and we took two seats (they charged us € 65 for less than 24 hours like the coaches) All the ground sloping. Cameras everywhere. just enter and take a ticket. Well located to visit Montserrat, but when heading towards the A2 towards Barcelona we saw good looking parking lots where there were motorhomes. May 2021"
22617,1179593,3,NiuBeach,25/04/2021,"We have spent tonight, perfect. Still in regional confinement, practicing alone for what is usual. Toilets and rubbish containers. Before 8am you have to park somewhere else to make room for the coaches. The only but is the difference in price to pay between a car and a van, in my case a T6, which is like a long saloon, occupies the same. Very friendly guards."
22617,1171272,3,Mutbegleiter,10/04/2021,"Thanks for the tip with paying at the ticket booth. I paid € 15 for 3.5 hours of parking and it was not very busy. At the machine, a camper from 30 minutes to 24 hours costs 65 €! Since the gondola and cogwheel railway are currently shut down, driving was the only way (aside from cycling and hiking) to get up here. It was worth it and I consider this 15 € to be an “entry fee”."
22617,1157404,5,Francis2408,25/03/2021,"Absolutely fantastic place, great view, great monastery, beautiful hiking trails! Everything you could wish for! We stood alone for 2 days. Going to the monastery at night is like being in a movie! The way up for the motorhome is easy to do, the road is wide enough and the slope is ok too. For our camper (23 years old, 6.5m no problem). Under no circumstances pay at the machine! He charges 65 € per day for a motorhome. When you drive out there is a house at the end where you can pay manually. Only here 20 € are charged for 3 days. If you get a stamp in the hotel, you save € 2.50. There is also a small kiosk at the monastery."
22617,1063266,5,Youlivan,21/09/2020,"From 7:00 p.m., they let you park in the bus parking lot to stay overnight, it is quite flat, we will spend the night here, at the entrance of the parking lot there is a guard who has opened the barriers and explained it to us, at 08 we have to leave the parking lot and park in the spaces set up to make room for the buses. Idyllic place to sleep very quiet, spectacular views and full 4G coverage."
22617,1027463,4,marabana,05/09/2020,"Good site, good views and necessary blocks. Updated price € 15 for vans and AC"

22617,783293,5,alexllou,20/02/2020,Just magical place! arrival around 1 p.m. not ideal! we parked on a slope between the cars. breathtaking hike. we moved the campsite because the very many visitors left. sunrise over the void and visit the monastery alone before the arrival of the buses ... well worth the detour. do not pay at the machines but at the barriers at the entrance to the car park
22617,779355,5,Marcus26,12/02/2020,"Very well ! we went for a walk at the end of the afternoon, we visited the monastery and the next day a little hike on the heights."
22617,775774,3,hugocamper,03/02/2020,"We arrived after 22:00 and very well, we were able to park in the upper part before the buses, we used the chocks to level the motorhome, very quiet, all night calm and without noise, only that of nocturnal animals. The visit to the monastery is better in the afternoon, fewer people, without queues, we take advantage of the morning to walk, it has many beautiful walking routes."
22617,751298,4,thegatehouses,08/12/2019,"Stayed 9 Nov.  Very, very busy and lots of cars stay in car park overnight.  Lots of coaches parked in the car parking spaces during the day, so no room until later afternoon. Space on an angle as others have said, so expected it.  Great access for walking to Sant Jeroni point.  Late afternoon visit to the basilica meant there we no queues."
22617,748983,4,theroverlanders,01/12/2019,"Brilliant location to properly explore Montserrat Natural Parc which is beautiful. Very sloping but we moved at 1900 to the coach parking and had a relatively peaceful night until 0600 when vehicles started moving, we moved out of the coach parking at 0730. Stayed for one night and two days for €8"
22617,745995,4,hannahhannah,22/11/2019,"Excellent location for visiting the monastery and exploring the hiking trails. Beautiful views and a very peaceful night. Slightly sloping car park but fixable with chocks, no specific spaces for motorhomes however we managed ok this time of year may be harder in summer months. €6.50 for 24 hours"
22617,683509,3,navi2000,09/09/2019,It is only worth paying if there are few people and you can park upstairs. If you do not have to upload the same as if you park outside for free.
22617,643627,5,bibiche72,19/08/2019,"Totally unexpected stop on August 18th. Very complicated to find something in the vicinity. We arrive at midnight by van, take a ticket and spend the night here, feeling safe. Nobody came to see us. early waking because tourists arrive early. We visit the site that we did not know. And finally very nice surprise. Remember to pay at the checkout at the exit of the site. 6.50 euros for 11h spent down. Beware of crates it can go up very quickly 52.50 euros"

22617,547277,5,padraigl,10/07/2019,"The parking here is paid. Make sure you pay at the manned kios on the way out. DO NOT USE THE AUTOMATED PAY STATIONS AS YOU WILL PAY BUS PRICES.... (€52 against €6.50 for 24hrs). Our 3 nights (69 hours total) cost €8 which is great value.

There is no dedicated parking for motorhomes. Nearly all the spaces are short or only just car length. You can park in the bus area which is flat but you can only move there after 7pm when the busses are gone and you have to move out at 7.30am the next morning for the next batch of busses to arrive.
All the parking is covered by security cameras.

Otherwise the best time to arrive is the evening when the cars are gone and you will have more choice. We spent 3 fantastic nights here in a perfect spot for our overhang as there are some oversized spaces in the carpark and you don't have to move. You will have to use your chocks as only the bus spaces are level. It gets very busy at weekends and a less busy during the week.

There are no services. Free services are in Monstril at the bottom of the hill. There are public toilets and fresh water fountains around the basilica.
There is free WiFi around the basilica.
There were no mosquitos here and we would know as they are attracted to us.

There are some nice walks from easy to difficult. The walk to Sant Jeroni is worth the effort but it's a good 4/5hrs return walk for serious hill walkers. You can take the funicular and it saves 1hr each way."

The road that goes by is quite busy with pedestrians and speeding cars but it gets better during the night. Police came by once an hour but did not say anything - we were happy about them because there were some strangers around. The spot and view is great. Please take your garbage - we cleaned everything although it was not our litter !

In itself, you can't vacation here unless you're plane spotter or noise resistant and have one of the premium pitches with a direct beach view. In high season you have to book two overpriced nights. As a bonus, depending on the wind direction, you can smell the sewage treatment plant extremely"

Not suitable for relaxing, OK for a city trip."

The worst, and that is very annoying, the noise of the planes, when they leave above the campsite (from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. they rest). The nearby beach is dirty, and with a strong smell of sewage."

Well laid out site with clean amenities. Hot water showers but bathroom not heated so not good in winter. Nice beach area where we were allowed to walk the dog but beach is restricted a little further north. The airport noise didn't bother us and it is convenient for travel on the bus with a small dog in a purpose made carrier."
22631,2579190,5,amstaffkora_,16/02/2023,"Minimum stay per plot 2 nights. The plot that was assigned to us was close to the bathrooms and the supermarket. The campsite has a restaurant. The bathrooms are clean. If I had to put something that I disliked, they don't heat the bathrooms. We took a rooftop tent and for the rest it was super good. We left the car at the campsite and took the bus and metro around Barcelona. €22 per night"
22631,2578671,3,jiri70,15/02/2023,"The campsite is suitable for visiting Barcelona. Bus L95 goes directly to the city center. At the reception you will receive a map on how to get to the bus. In the camp, there is constant noise from airplanes taking off from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. They don't fly at night. The minus is for the showers and toilets, which have a margin in cleanliness."

Hmmmm just pay attention!"

22631,2556141,4,armene,20/01/2023,"Very quiet campsite at this time of year. Numerous plane passages during the day but without much inconvenience in our opinion. Camping facing the sea for the lucky ones choosing these pitches €36 per night, it's paradise. Very clean toilets. The only downside is the place for emptying gray and black water next to the clean water refill, it's a horror. The staff is super friendly."
22631,2555164,1,MPapp,19/01/2023,"Extremely uncomfortable atmosphere. Also quite expensive at €32 per night for 2 people with a campervan. You get nothing for your money except the proximity to Barcelona. There is a constant smell of poop throughout the campsite.

The only way to get into town is by bus, the journey takes over an hour and even longer if there is a traffic jam. So look for a place that has a train or metro connection. Dogs are not allowed on the buses, but are allowed on the metro and are free of charge (short leash and muzzle). The place is expensive and bad."
22631,2543002,3,famharts,05/01/2023,Our first night we stayed at the edge of the campsite which felt like being on a carpark. In summer this is a good spot for shadow. Next day we moved.Direct access to the beach and a direct bus to Barcelona. Supermarket in the campsite is closed in January and other supermarkets are at least 2.5km away. Toilets and showers are outdated and not very clean. Good water pressure in the showers!

With a length of 9 meters, we also got there well. Airplanes: didn't bother us. (For dog owners: unfortunately visiting Barcelona with a dog is difficult, dogs are not allowed on the bus, only leave a taxi or the dog in the camper)"

You can hear planes taking off. This morning only planes came to land via this route and then it was quieter. Restaurant very tasty. Geau and black water system was not very hygienic and this morning guests had unfortunately left them very dirty."
22631,2531077,5,JasminB7,28/12/2022,"very nice and quiet campsite with a direct view of the sea! Sanitary facilities are clean. Since we are traveling as a couple with two vehicles (4m & 6m), the gentleman at the reception pointed out to us that we would get cheaper with a premium place on which both vehicles have space instead of booking 2 individual standard places. Very nice!"

Was still well attended in November (reserve for several nights if necessary). Good bus connection to Barcelona. With about 30 €/night for two campers a bit more expensive."
22631,2511173,3,superhase,02/12/2022,"The campsite offers everything you need. Unfortunately, the showers are not heated and in November it was a bit cold when taking a shower. Unfortunately, the WoMo drinking water point is very desolate and difficult to operate. You have to keep pressing a very stiff button, which is almost impossible. In addition, a lot of water runs at the outlet next to it. Not ok for €30.00 stand fee."

Unfortunately the noise is unbearable (planes and road). During our stay there was a disgusting stench over the place (sewage treatment plant?!). Otherwise we would have stayed longer.
22631,2481853,2,Vee91,04/11/2022,"The campsite itself was okay. The beach really nice. The women's sanitary facilities were really disgusting. Defecation on the walls, which was not cleaned even after several days. Toilets always dirty. Hardly any water came out of the shower heads. Strong aircraft noise, but we were aware of this beforehand. A plane takes off from here every 2 minutes. Between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. Should you know."
22631,2479378,3,kimjan,02/11/2022,"Is OK for Barcelona trip. We took dogs into town with the ""Pet Taxi Barcelona"". 70 € there and back. Relatively expensive, however, dogs are only allowed on the bus with a box. Sanitary facilities clean. We were among permanent campers, place E19. Not recommendable. Rather ask for space on the edge. Sewage and fresh water Place is dirty, we didn't refill fresh water there."
22631,2470115,2,woidl7,29/10/2022,"Beautiful beach, direct access from the campsite and friendly staff. Sanitary facilities getting old and not always clean. Unfortunately, the pitches in the middle of the permanent campers are not recommended. Questionable audience that apparently uses the weekends here for binge drinking with the whole clan. Anyone looking for peace and relaxation is better off somewhere else."
22631,2467668,4,MickaelDQ,28/10/2022,"A good campsite near the buses to Barcelona, 25€ per night for 2 adults and 3 children via ACSI. The toilets are recent, clean and maintained but the people are disrespectful, it's a shame but not the responsibility of the campsite. Aircraft noise is present but it's not the most disturbing thing given the attitude of some residents and locals who don't mind… I therefore recommend pitches along the beach to be quieter."
22631,2463743,1,Camille37,26/10/2022,"Campsite under the airport take-off runway (1 plane every 2 minutes from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.), next to the highway and the wastewater treatment plant (smell depending on the wind), for calm it is missed . Also, it's the factory, the slots are small and stuck together. Basically run away if you want to rest! Think about mosquito repellent too. Only advantage, close to Barcelona."
22631,2463191,1,fan4womo,26/10/2022,"At first glance a campsite, with large pitches, under trees, and everything you need. But that's not true: small, black mosquitoes and big, fat bugs without end! There were still metal pegs stuck in my seat. Plates! And the supply was only for chemical toilet flushing! There is no connection for your own hose! Everything is old, broken and neglected. Exit!"

The complex has individual planted plots which provide good privacy and privacy. The sanitary facilities are in need of renovation but still ok. No urinals in the men's toilet, which meant that the toilets were correspondingly uncomfortable. Individual shower stalls with no dedicated changing area. The shower heads radiate very far. In the evening it was very noisy because there was a party on the opposite side of the street until 4 o'clock in the morning. The square neighbors, however, were very quiet. Since there was hardly any wind on the campsite, it hardly cooled down at night. You can walk to the bus stop to Barcelona in about 10 minutes. For €2.40 you drive 50 minutes to “Pl. Universitata"" in Barcelona. The last bus on the line leaves Barcelona at around 10:30 p.m. Alternatively, there are connections by train and night bus. Two stars because of the noise and cleanliness and the need for renovation of the toilets."

The places are just but narrow because of the many trees. Showers are ok, we didn't use the toilet. Bus stop is within walking distance, goes directly to the city. The beach is nice, unfortunately many dogs..."
22631,1848841,3,LphiVan,23/04/2022,"Ideally placed to visit Barcelona leaving the van in a safe place. Bus 94 or 95 will take you there in 45' (NB: then take a T-familar card which allows you to move around Barcelona with others and to return to the campsite: 10€ for 8 trips to share). For the rest, the campsite is quite ordinary. It is placed under the air corridor (planes from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.). The beach is not clean and the dump station is in poor condition…"
22631,1846500,2,L.I.,22/04/2022,"The place only benefits from its proximity to the city, which means 45 minutes by bus. Pitches themselves are unkempt and when it rains you are in the Mocke. Electricity included, but the fuse blows easily and you have to get help. Fetching fresh water at the disposal station is a hygienic catastrophe. The access roads are poorly thought out and in poor condition. Too expensive."
22631,1843487,5,FamilyBun,21/04/2022,"After reading previous reviews, we booked in advance. Arrival on site the pitches are spacious for the lucky ones in the shelter of the pines. The toilets and showers are clean and well maintained. The water is very hot. Overall the campsite is very well maintained and with many services and direct access to the beach! We highly recommend!!"
22631,1831288,3,genie13,17/04/2022,It is absolutely necessary to make the reservation on the internet otherwise they say that it is full do not hesitate to go around the campsite to choose its location especially when you have a large motorhome Barcelona is easily accessible with buses 94 and 95 2€ 40 the ticket then bought a day ticket to the metro which allows unlimited free movement in Barcelona
22631,1817603,2,Sunlightvan,12/04/2022,"Campsite is ok. Standard slot for €25/night with electricity for the location on the beach was ok. Place itself is so well. Paramedic facilities could use some cleaning supplies. Showers are nice and big. Now let's get to the point why there are only 2 stars. When we arrived in the afternoon, we were sent away again because everything was said to be full (the campers before and after us felt the same way). There is no space left without a reservation. We had previously checked online reservations. So we made a reservation at the next gas station and drove back. Got a place for 2 nights with no problems. Pretty strange..."
22631,1811285,1,zenruffinen,09/04/2022,"Places by the sea. 80% occupied by mobile homes. Close to the airport and frequent overflight, almost every minute in the morning, by planes taking off. Very dirty and poorly maintained campsite, the paths are strewn with holes and the garbage cans are overflowing with rubbish already in the morning. Few cleaning staff. We have a Nespresso coffee machine and we were denied the sale of capsules"
22631,1808601,5,bluegibson96,06/04/2022,"Fantastic campsite, great amenities. €2.40 on the bus directly into Barcelona!"
22631,1797973,4,Saschke,27/03/2022,"Simple campsite with heated, clean bath and restaurant. Access to beautiful, quiet beach. You can get to downtown Barcelona by bus in 50 minutes for €2.40, which can be reached on foot in about 10 minutes and runs at regular intervals until late in the evening."
22631,1790794,5,bangiverden,21/03/2022,"Very clean and nice site, surprisingly quiet right on the beach, very friendly and helpful staff, perfect for a visit to Barcelona. Not expensive considering location and proximity, can only recommend"
22631,1785329,5,monikatomas,16/03/2022,"Beautiful camp! Nice and helpful staff.  We were here at a time when it was blowing a lot, the only thing I would point out was that the showers were not so hot.  Absolutely unique place to discover Barcelona- we stayed 4 nights in the end."
22631,1784074,2,SuzyJ,15/03/2022,"Yes there is a lot of air traffic but the site is on the beach, perfect for dogs. wifi didn't work. restaurant definitely not recommended, way too expensive for food which clearly comes from the freezer. plumbing was neat only shower spray really too hard, just hurt. Some weird people were hanging out at the campsite. You can enter the campsite in 3 places without any control."
22631,1778637,4,reisender06,09/03/2022,"Very good for visiting Barcelona. Bus 300 m next to square goes directly to Plsca Catalunya. Equipment good. The only downside: no place, no bars etc. Paid 21 euros including electricity in March."
22631,1775043,4,bamboobus,06/03/2022,"A nice campsite, we had a pitch right on the beach. The sanitary facilities were large and clean, two buses go directly to downtown Barcelona. One star deducted as you can hear the planes very close to the airport and the WiFi doesn't work well."
22631,1759823,2,MobyDick1979,19/02/2022,"The showers are very calcified and not exactly clean. Our lot was full of dog poo! Disgusting! When we told the front desk they apologized, but there was no discount. WiFi reception was terrible. You can hear planes super loud all the time. We would not come back. 2 stars because the place was open in February."
22631,1749532,4,sebjohn38,06/02/2022,"Super campsite by the sea, heated and clean sanitary facilities. The barcelona flat at 1 hour with the L95. The planes did not disturb us, landing in the morning, no noise, takeoff in the afternoon a little noisy, but largely bearable."
22631,1744010,4,QQXAlain,30/01/2022,"Very friendly staff. The campsite normally opened on February 4, but they let us stay 3 nights, besides there were already other camper vans. Only one toilet block open, given the low attendance, it was clean and warm. The price of 22€ includes electricity, the only service terminal for 2 vehicles is shabby, but works, we were able to empty and refill."
22631,1736171,3,simba12,17/01/2022,"Campground closed, only bungalows are rented, ask if you can only stay one night. If I could stay with a mobile home, I am the only mobile home in the first row. The place is very nice, staff very friendly."
22631,1693247,1,manut4,19/11/2021,"The campsite is closed, but you can rent a bungalow for a month. That would work, said the conveyor at the barrier. We had to keep going."
22631,1679896,4,seb3102,06/11/2021,"We stayed there for 5 nights for 156 € (2 adults and 2 children) with elec 6A. clean sanitary facilities, welcoming staff who speak French, a very well done Halloween animation on the 31st. For Barcelona, line 95 will take you to Catalunya Square in 40 minutes, € 2.40 per ticket, buy the family pass in town for 8 trips and € 10."
22631,1670649,3,cecedu24,31/10/2021,Very practical campsite if you want to go to Barcelona. On the other hand very noisy because of the airport 1 plane every 3 minutes. So it's just a great campsite for sightseeing. Snack still open at the end of October
22631,1670402,2,StefanieKurtz,31/10/2021,"Minimum stay is 3 nights! Very loud aircraft noise the whole day (6:00 - 24:00), which makes conversation outside almost impossible. Very expensive (30 € per night) with mediocre equipment. Sanitary facilities are very clean."
22631,1670399,3,jurgenmeinert,31/10/2021,"Clean and nice place, but you have to pay for a minimum of 3 days. This pulls down a bit, in addition the aircraft noise is a bit annoying at times."
22631,1668572,4,ingrid517,30/10/2021,"Very friendly and pleasant welcome Clean great location (5 min walk from a bus stop which takes 50 min to the center of Barcelona for 2.40 E / pers and along the sea) yes there are planes and the purring of the 4-way: it didn't stop us from sleeping! (2 adults and 3 children) and for a small price: 30 E / night, our bedroom was secure, with hot water, electricity ... in short IDEAL"
22631,1665755,3,SietskeIm,28/10/2021,"You have to stay a minimum of 3 nights. Also, didn't find the reception all that friendly. We drove on."
22631,1658309,5,Sonja5299,23/10/2021,"Very great campsite. The sanitary facilities were very clean and were cleaned 3-4 times a day. The staff was very friendly and spoke many languages, which made checking in very easy. The planes are noisy but on the whole are not that annoying. I can absolutely recommend the place! Would go back anytime!"
22631,1655076,4,JessyBKing,21/10/2021,"Nice campsite, sanitary facilities were always kept clean. The city can be reached quickly by bus or taxi. We were there with two dogs, unfortunately there was no dog shower"
22631,1654948,4,Pia89,21/10/2021,"Great camping site with access to the beach. You can get to Barcelona by bus. It takes about 50 minutes. Since the campsite is near the airport, you can hear the planes taking off from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m."
22631,1635790,4,Ladde,09/10/2021,"Great campsite with clean sanitary facilities, even if the pitches are a bit narrow and dusty. You don't notice the street noise when you stand behind the wall. The aircraft noise from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. is a bit annoying, but this campsite is the ideal starting point for day trips to Barcelona. You should plan about an hour for the bus into the city."
22631,1619363,4,nickmawby,30/09/2021,"Convenient for visiting Barcelona,an hour by bus.  Aircraft noise and fumes from industry depending on wind direction.  Standard pitches very small (which you get with ASCI CC).  Premium beachfront pitches available.  Immaculately clean sanitation blocks and very hot and powerful showers."
22631,1612989,3,SylvainCharnole,27/09/2021,"Very close to the airport, to the expressway, therefore noisy. Loud music on Friday and Saturday evening. Convenient for visiting Barcelona in peace and safety for vehicles. 10 min to the bus stop on foot and 40 minutes by bus to the Spanish Steps in Barcelona. Friendly, French-speaking staff. Clean and functional sanitary facilities. Direct access to the beach and the swimming pool included."
22631,1604879,4,emeliedemeester,24/09/2021,"Indeed, you sleep on a campsite with a lot of noise as the planes take off above your head. At night there is a break but early in the morning it starts again. We slept in a roof tent and are both good sleepers and it was actually not that bad! Since this is the only campsite left in Barcelona, we expected it to be worse. Paid 28 euros per night with a van, which is also doable. 50 min by bus to the city is quite long but your camper / van is safe at the campsite. Clean sanitary facilities and shop on site with fresh baguette in the morning (other than that, don't expect too much). We were satisfied."
22631,1595959,4,ortimey,20/09/2021,"Perfect for a visit to Barcelona. Bus connection available. However, we ourselves dodged the taxi with the dogs - just under € 35 a tour (no dogs allowed on the bus). The place is very professional, clean and friendly. Air traffic, however, was already clearly audible. But one likes to ignore the fact that the camper is safe when visiting Barcelona"
22631,1543248,3,lisakhb,03/09/2021,"At first we were given a seat that was already occupied ... In general, the staff was not really friendly. Overall, the campsite is a bit expensive and very noisy. The beach is okay and you can eat well in the restaurant. The supermarket has a good selection and is open every day. A good place to visit Barcelona, rather not recommended as a campsite to relax."
22631,1536000,2,Drmduarte,01/09/2021,There are few options near Barcelona. But the beach is horrible and the whole park smells of sewage... It can be seen as a parking option to visit Barcelona
22631,1517794,3,JoschW,27/08/2021,"We only stand here for 2 nights to visit Barcelona, the place is also guarded, which is good! Unfortunately extremely loud until late at night. Doesn't seem to matter to the people here that some people want to sleep. It's a shame, actually"
22631,1484573,5,LindaSWM,19/08/2021,"Great Camping! We were in the square from Sunday to Wednesday. The welcome was very warm, great sanitary facilities, direct beach access, restaurant & mini market. A bus leaves the center of Barcelona every 20 minutes and takes around 30 minutes. We will be back!"
22631,1440954,4,JMB69,11/08/2021,"We spent 3 nights from May 28 to 31, 2021. Good campsite with gray / black water drainage area. Correct price: 26 € for a van. Pitches with sea view more expensive but less pleasant because they are glued to the fence along the beach, without any shade. 10/12 minutes to reach the bus stop which serves the center of Barcelona (2 lines) then a 30-minute journey."
22631,1410019,3,andrea8374,05/08/2021,"Disappointing the pu pool, lukewarm showers at 8pm, wifi do not work !! 2 person 47th standard pitches, abused but not the only choice next to the airport"
22631,1325578,3,TheresaKatein,15/07/2021,"For the price (€ 62 for a 3-person campervan on a standard pitch), the campsite could be a bit more neat. The sanitary facilities are ok. The planes from the nearby airport can be heard very clearly. The beach belonging to the camping is great. The security / video surveillance at all entrances makes you feel very safe. The bus connection to the center of Barcelona is relatively good."
22631,1323996,2,cqfd,14/07/2021,"I find the comments excessive because paying 62 € per night on July 12, 2021 certainly seems delusional to me there are showers on the beach but as the owner admits they are in a monopoly situation and do not want foreigners or Spaniards less fortunate in their campsite because they would be a source of disorder"
22631,1317293,1,mimivan,12/07/2021,They have to be kidding. They wanted to charge us € 45 for a single night in a VW California ...
22631,1306814,4,doulic,08/07/2021,"Well-equipped campsite, all amenities, access to the beach, pleasant swimming pool."
22631,1288266,4,aparicio09,01/07/2021,"Nice Beaches, (strong winds, for surfers) good food, nice restaurant, very good service, in several languages, excellent security, for families, plots from the beachfront."
22631,1284836,4,CaraDrummond,29/06/2021,"In itself a nice camp spot, a bit too full / big for my taste and for the 72 € for 2 nights / 2 people. I would have liked good WiFi. Otherwise to be recommended, especially the proximity to the ""private"" beach section is great. :)"
22631,1254828,5,NastiaFromRussia,14/06/2021,"Absolutely gorgeous camping! cheapest option: 1van 2persons = 21€ a day. electricity is inclusive. swimming pool is amazing! very safe. all entrances controlled by guards via gates with cameras. bus to barcelona: each ticket 2,4€, 45min ride."
22631,1248581,4,maxmstrmann,11/06/2021,"Admittedly, it was Friday, but I found the check-in time to be 45 minutes very long. Good location for visiting Barcelona and very clean and modern sanitary facilities. With my converted van (5m) and two adults we paid € 19 for one night. (2 € ADAC discount);)"
22631,1241345,4,zweihasndierasn,07/06/2021,Direct access to the beach! Bus into town 50 minutes to Place Catalonya. On Saturday evening the bus is too full and it no longer picks up people at the bus stop. Then rather walk one stop further. Aircraft noise is kept within limits. We didn't find it disturbing. But it may also be due to Corona that so few planes are on the way. Sanitary facilities perfectly fine! Shop and washing machine available. Security at the entrances and exits. We felt very safe.
22631,1210666,4,DebbyCtH,22/05/2021,"Nice campsite on your way to Italy. On the beach. Plumbing is neat. Shop and bar and plenty to do. Not necessary for us, but everything is there. Also great to watch the planes take off and land. To be repeated. And yes there are many Spaniards on the campsite and there was music in the evening. But that's a culture thing I guess. They enjoy the evening and the weekend. Not a problem for us"
22631,1208739,4,shollak,21/05/2021,"Great campsite if you are going to visit Barcelona. The standard camper spots are large. We were there during the week and it was quiet and clean. And € 19 a night is not much for such a city. We went to Barcelona by bus. For some reason it did not reach the center, but we could easily get through a few stops by metro. Returned by taxi (€ 40) so no experience with the bus to get back."
22631,1208415,4,Robuga,20/05/2021,"Good camping. They treated us very well. They gave us a choice of € 26 per night. All the services. Reasonably good, modern and clean facilities Very quiet. 1 hour 10 min walk to the airport metro. I give 4 * for bad connection with Barcelona. We walked to the airport to carry a dog. The return by taxi € 20 from the airport. Dogfriendly taxis and metro."
22631,1202790,3,Stegerberger,16/05/2021,"In itself a nice campsite right on the beach. Staff speak good English and are ready to help with any questions. By bus (bus stop approx. 10 minutes on foot) you are in Barcelona in approx. 35 minutes. There is a supermarket and a laundromat (€ 5.50 for 30 minutes of washing). There are many permanent campers here on the site. We're here out of season but over a weekend. It was extremely loud until late at night and the sanitary facilities were extremely dirty, especially in the evening. There was smoking in the toilets, beer cans were lying around everywhere and the toilets were completely shitty (sorry for the expression). I don't want to know how it is here in the main season."
22631,1199682,5,fizzghigg,15/05/2021,"Pleasant campsite, 26 € sea view for 2 adults, 1 electric van and a dog (5 € less for a classic pitch). Nice bar and restaurant (and open from morning to evening even out of season). Clean sanitary facilities (1 single block open for the entire campsite out of season except weekends)."
22631,1101755,5,ju59,22/10/2020,Very good campsite 5km from the airport! Count 18 € for a taxi to the airport! CC + trailer + 2 adults and a child: 23 € / day facing the sea! Friendly and helpful staff! I recommend
22631,1085573,5,marie5962,08/10/2020,"Well-stocked campsite with grocery store, restaurant and bar. Out of season, we were offered facing the sea, at a low price with ACSI, a real treat. And easy to get to Barcelona by bus, we recommend it."
22631,1073610,5,BeatrizMartinez,28/09/2020,"Nice camping !!! It has all the very clean services. They have all kinds of plots, the last ones facing the sea. We will be back!"

22631,1040031,5,giachen,11/09/2020,"I loved a really great family campsite with friendly and open staff. If you get involved in the Spanish mentality, great friendships develop"
22631,843316,5,Elcreco,30/06/2020,"I would say it is a busy campsite, which means full of life. Children play, take off, and a neat sea beer. In good German Barcelona style! Those who are looking for peace and quiet like in the cemetery have no business here;) just on the edge. Beach is super toilet clean, supermarket has everything you need, space was great. Price 2 people Van Strom € 36 a night"
22631,793849,4,JuergenD,10/03/2020,"Very friendly welcome by a perfectly German speaking employee. Parcel with sea view € 24, all others € 19 with ACSI. At the beginning of March it was very windy on the sea view parcels, so we preferred to move 4-5 rows backwards. Rebooking was not a problem. There were plenty of sunny and shady free places. Sanitary area ok, small supermarket with fresh too. Bus stop to Barcelona 600m away. For € 2.40 to Plaza Catalunya. Attention: on the way back the stop at the campsite is called 'Autovia de Castelldefels km 186'."
22631,793681,5,Rafaespinos,10/03/2020,"We spent 2 people on Sunday night, € 21, the simplest plot with electricity included, it is close to the airport but within the van I did not find out about the planes, recommended camping and with good services."
22631,781986,5,lukyT6,17/02/2020,"Very nice places right on the beach. Some flight noise during the day, but nothing at night. Nice reception and clean toilets and showers. We were there one night and would come back anytime! The food in the restaurant was also delicious and large portions."
22631,781842,4,mham83,17/02/2020,"Handy site with friendly reception staff located right on the beach. For 3 nights with 2 adults and a child plus a dog it cost us €72 with an ACSI card and that was for a beach side pitch (worth the extra few €). The only down side is the proximity to Barcelona airport but flights do stop at around 22:30 and don’t resume until about 07:00. Highly recommend due to its location, only a 25 minute drive into Barcelona."
22631,780748,5,flyingkiwi,15/02/2020,"Stayed 4 nights. Cost €19 with ASCI card includes 2 adults and 1 dog. Paid extra for 2nd dog. We took the advice and didn’t pay extra for the beach site, but instead opted to be close to the amenities. Mistake: in Winter the beach spots are light and sunny whereas the interior sites are shady, with no light.  Moved to beach site the last night. Amenities are clean and modern. Recommend."
22631,779940,4,Nanane08,13/02/2020,"As described. Lots of services. Clean, secure and well maintained. 19 € for 2 in motorhome. We hear planes during the day, but hey ... I will come back to this"
22631,778131,5,tomb5607,09/02/2020,"Place was really clean everything you need not worth paying extra for sea view though kind of got talked into it without seeing the pitch, located well to vist Barcelona nice and secure place. yes the planes are loud and a little annoying but if you want to vist Barcelona and not sit by the beach relaxing this is the place."
22631,775207,4,ColinL,02/02/2020,"Stayed here in February, cost €19 euros a night with my ASCI card. For that price it was good, very good shower blocks and laundry and the paella in the on site restaurant was surprisingly good. The bus to Barcelona is about half an hour and costs €2.40. During the day the airport noise is obvious but I’d stay here again."
22631,766608,3,Aloisp,09/01/2020,"Nice place right on the beach. Unfortunately, the neighboring airport cannot be missed. Maintained wash houses. Small laundromat on the square. We wanted to come back over Christmas. Unfortunately the place was closed, which was not evident on the homepage."
22631,762218,1,Doreen84,02/01/2020,"Gate was closed, nobody reached by phone!"
22631,761760,3,pmoncla,01/01/2020,"Open all year round but gate closed on 01/01/2020 ... I did not understand if there was another entrance ... in short, ask before you show up at the gate."
22631,760736,4,WhiteRastas,31/12/2019,"The campsite is very well equipped. There are various rental accommodations, but also parking spaces for the accommodation of your own accommodation. The pitches are all parceled out and differ in different categories. We spent five days on the square in December. Our parking space was the B 15, right on the sea with a sea view. The space was still generous for our 9m long vehicle, so that we could also develop. You can enjoy the sunrise on the beach in the morning and the sunset in the evening. We haven't had such a nice and spacious place right by the sea for a long time. The square is an ideal starting point to explore Barcelona. In just a few minutes you are at the bus stop from where you can get to the city by bus. The staff is always friendly, whether you are checking in, ordering in a restaurant or shopping in a shop. In the shop you can get baguette sticks during opening hours, which we always got for breakfast. They are baked there themselves and always look delicious fresh. Only the price is a bit expensive. In the discounter they cost over half less. A glass of Nutella should cost € 4.50, which I think is already excessive. The sanitary facilities are equipped with everything you need. There is also an accessible bathroom. Everything was very neat and clean. There is a small laundromat where dryers and washing machines are available. In the high season there is a pool that was not accessible during our stay. There is a mini golf course, an exercise park with free sports equipment, a place for the kids and a restaurant with pizza, noodle dishes and typical dishes. The two of us had paid 26.00 € per night for our parking space by the sea, which was a bit too expensive for us personally for the actual low season. We could not stay that long, so we looked for the next stage, again a significantly cheaper RV parking space. The place right by the sea has a fantastic location. It is very well equipped. The public transport connection is very good. The staff are very friendly. Everything is neat and tidy. Only the price / performance ratio was personally too expensive for us in the off-season. Therefore, we only give four of the actual five stars."
22631,749423,4,Motorhome.life.l.l.c,02/12/2019,We stayed 3 nights 21euros with ACSI card. Site on a main road and next to airport. Lots of planes taking off from 6am to about 11pm. Good location to Barcelona (45 mins on bus) and next to beach.
22631,744739,5,campingfred,18/11/2019,"In November 21 € for a normal place, 26 € for place by the sea. Great campsite with easy access to Barcelona. Good equipment with a small supermarket."
22631,740205,5,patgardo,08/11/2019,Very very welcome and in several languages. 26 € by the sea.
22631,730208,4,JuliasBulli,26/10/2019,"Large campsite that is open all year. Although it is right on the beach, but unfortunately the pitches are separated by a chain link fence from the beach. Too bad that is right next to the airport of Barcelona and thus every hour aircraft take off or land. The sanitary facilities are top. We only paid two people and two dogs in a Bulli for 1 night 32 €."
22631,728357,5,ROOM2901,23/10/2019,"Excellent! Although out of season, the restaurant where paella marisco is recommended was open. The supermarket was open by the hour. Standing in the first row by the sea! Great view! Gladly again"

very helpful workers

dirti bathrooms
hard to build the tent
close to the airport, every 5 minutes they take off
smell of the beach and smell on the campsite was horrible. Close to the campsite there is a dirty river which run just into the see. The smell on the campsite was really bad
restaurant - price higher than Barcelona"
22631,702340,4,martinet27,23/09/2019,Camping quite correct to visit Barcelona without risk for the Camping car .. anyway there is nothing in Barcelona to park and sleep in the shelter .. 21 € for 2 with electricity and all amenities
22631,669924,2,jean66,31/08/2019,"It's a small campsite with all the services, it does its best to give everything possible. Neat, normally clean, direct access to the beach, pool and wifi. Negative: It is far from the city and it is absolutely not ideal to visit it, you can hear a plane taking off every 3 minutes until late at night, it is a mosquito farm, if you do not have mosquito nets think twice."
22631,650059,2,topovito,22/08/2019,"It should be noted its proximity to the beach (although doubting its health, I have bathed and I am alive ...). There is free wi-fi but its signal is very weak. There are accommodations and plots for all tastes and the cleaning service, as with all other services, I have found more than correct."
22631,650046,2,topovito,22/08/2019,"If the previous comments were positive and I did not know the area, I would put a star ... But finally, knowing the area and reading so much negative comment did not seem so terrible. It is an ideal campsite to visit BCN and ideal for families that the bustle feeds them as there are many activities for children."
22631,634863,1,jcmberthe,16/08/2019,We stayed 4 nights. The good points are: it is very convenient to visit Barcelona. The beach is next. The bus stop is nearby. Negatives: Camping very very noisy It is at the end of the runway from there Barcelona airport One plane every 4 minutes all day long It's easy to sleep at night Most of the sanitary facilities are not clean. I think that vacationers are not. The reception is more than passable. There is no network or wifi
22631,612809,3,emcl79,09/08/2019,"No more room ... half a round at the gate, we were told that we had to book."
22631,606782,5,carolelphe,07/08/2019,"Very surprised again negative reviews where once again, people should go to the hotel and stop the camper! So certainly there are planes but frankly not disturbing at all. Quiet and family campsite with very affordable rates for Barcelona (58 €) beautiful pitches I recommend"
22631,545664,4,prettylatina,09/07/2019,"You always hear the planes but that does not bother you. The sanitary facilities could be a bit cleaner, but still totally. There is a supermarket and restaurant and direct access to the beach. the womo places are partly surrounded by trees."
22631,530070,5,donalandger,27/06/2019,Giving it 5 to up the rating up from a couple of very negative comments in the past here now with a beachfront pitch for 26e (non beach side 21e) the best value for camping I found in this area. There appears to be some refugee families here permanently but very quiet and safe facilities are good but as the previous comments some housekeeping is needed for the services. I will stay again
22631,468026,3,gogh,26/04/2019,"In April 20€ standard pitch (2pers + child), 6A el. included. Very convenient for Barcelona visit, bus stop  with direct line to Pl. Espanya and Catalunya is 10 min walk from camp (price 2,20€ or less if you have T-10 ticket). Pitches are nice and large, however most of them is in sand which is not so nice (at least for us :-)). Bathrooms are new and with lot of showers and toilets, but they are not heated and are very dirty. Also there is no place, bench, shelf nor a hook to hang clothes and towels in a shower!? Service area for campers is also dirty and hose for water filling lies on the ground where toilet dump is, with a little effort that could be organized better. Last, but not least - airport is next to the camp site and you can hear them take on and off all day, but during the night it was quiet and we slept very well"

SORRY extremely disturbing the next door airport with entry and departure lane (6 clock to 22 clock) directly above the campsite."
22631,432256,3,xaf,22/02/2019,Camping with many bungalows but also with many plots.They are currently renovating the bathrooms and we have found a good campsite. The parcels in front of the sea are incredible! The noise of the airplanes you get used to and they are not a problem. Buses to Barcelona. They accept ACSI card and the wifi is free. We travel a lot to BCN and it will be a camping that we will visit more times!

In the town there are signs that clearly indicate that you cannot stay overnight."

The swimming pool is great, very welcoming, they had placed us in the center like all the CCs but since we have a big dog they accepted that we change to the places next to the fence of the swimming pool which are very shaded. To visit the very atypical village!"

22633,1614468,2,PacoTabaco,28/09/2021,"Old facilities without maintenance. Dirty bathrooms, smelling of urine, with sensor lights that go off after two seconds. Large plots full of anthill. 1 camper, two people without light; € 22.50"
22633,1593129,4,AlfredoMoralejo,19/09/2021,"A good option for that area. The campsite is well cared for, with good pitches, well defined and good treatment. In August quite crowded and it is difficult to enjoy the pool. Next to the town of El Rocío that deserves a good visit."
22633,1446371,4,amaiasandua,12/08/2021,"Correct camping, taking into account that it is the Rocío by the dust of the road, plots of sand or dry grass, delimited, emptying and filling correctly, the best the pool is luxurious. Price is affordable € 24 a day one Ac and two adults with electricity."
22633,1442772,4,ttattinniss,12/08/2021,"We have spent a couple of days. Good camping, spacious, marked pitches, young trees but with shade, comfortable and clean facilities, although some arrangement is missing. Great pool with recreation area. Keep in mind that you are in El Rocío so dust is a constant. Correct staff. As an improvement, we would have liked a longer pool hours (opens at 12)."
22633,1419836,3,GuioGs,07/08/2021,"Correct camping. Many parcels of sand / land, delimited by hedges. Gray water area very well, black far away. The pool full of people for the time of year. 7 euros per adult and 9 AC without electricity"
22633,1393516,4,marcguille,02/08/2021,"I do not go into the campsites because it is not our thing and because they are dirty. but this one is different. Tidy, clean, caring and grassy pitches. Double the price of an area but at least it has a pool and clean. Correct water discharge. Sewage is the point with the greatest deficit. It is the best option for zone 30e Auto 740 two adults and one child"
22633,1386348,1,Quim-Gisela,31/07/2021,"As a last option, okay. We arrived late, with the campsite empty and the next day, after regularizing, we asked to go out after lunch and they told us no, that at 12 noon. The pool opened at 12 o'clock and they didn't let us take a dip for the children, except for 6 euros. They also do not allow, neither paying to fill nor to empty, if you do not sleep. Fair, old facilities and not very empathetic customer service"

Very special to see people on horseback at the bar… You can also easily go to the nature reserve from the campsite. Free walking trails from nearby visitor centers. Very nice for bird watching."

White and gray water in the car wash, and black in a chemical toilet next to the changing rooms, showers, toilets, washing machine, sink. Just one but. There is a path next to the campsite, in the left area, where vehicles with cars pass and make a lot of noise. For the rest, the afternoon, night and tomorrow has been very good.

22633,458598,2,phoebegg,18/04/2019,"Basic campsite with the facilities having the feel of some kind of barracks/prison shower block! Not quite sure what you’re paying for with the price apart from the honour of visiting El Rocio, which to be fair is well worth the visit. Can’t park anywhere else overnight as prohibited in the entire town, but el Rocio is amazingly unique! Like a Wild West town on a wetland! First time seeing glossy ibis and spoonbills. Take your binoculars! Also lots of black kites. Famous for their horses which fits very well with the town, and the pilgrimage that sees 1 million people in the town having a party! (Hence all the hermanidads - brotherhoods)"

When we went back to the front desk to show her, she did not even apologize. Just because it's the only campsite on the site does not mean that you have to forget about it. A. Ba of politeness. Village to visit, camping to avoid"
22633,385094,4,grangurug,30/09/2018,"Good option to be near Doñana. As of the third night, € 19 per day is cheaper. Except kitchen has the rest of the services. It has laundry with washing machine and dryer, dishes, filling and emptying of gray and black, swimming pool, free wifi."

Gray water drain on location (with hose) and drinking water. We were poorly received at the front desk and an ugly feeling of disturbing. On the other hand this is not the case of the staff in the campsite who is very friendly. Free Wifi but very slow. Store of the campsite without interest. The village of El Rocio, very close, is very particular, all the streets are in sand and an impression of far west. Some inhabitants ride on horseback and tie their animals in front of the buildings. Very difficult on a scooter."

22686,2866869,1,pedritoterol,18/06/2023,It is not worth going 25 euros a day the pool closes at 8:00 p.m. the garbage smells and they do not pick up the trees the plots are not pruned or cleaned the result is many mosquitoes and when after a weekend you want to stay on Sunday afternoon they want to charge you a whole day. I'M SURE THE CAMPING ADDRESS CHANGED. I've been a customer for about 4 years and it wasn't like that before. Not recommendable
22686,2783904,2,doreenpetrova,25/05/2023,The campsite is very old!

The tram runs right on the beach, parallel to the promenade. At the weekend unfortunately relatively noisy from the surrounding properties. In the evening, the voltage fluctuates, so the refrigerator has to switch to gas (same with the neighbors)."
22686,2701790,3,Stefaniefeichtner,27/04/2023,The places are ok but be careful because of the internet. You can buy internet for 2 euros for 2 people.

Plots are large but access can be very tight in places so best to ask if you have a large van. Super clean and the staff are amazing. Thankyou for your hospitality this winter
22686,2576930,4,Jane23,13/02/2023,"A seat reservation worked well by email. Currently few free pitches, numerous winterers. A very special compliment for the super clean sanitary facilities. The ladies at the reception are friendly. There is a good map of El Campello. Delicious bakery around the corner. TRAM connection, no bike paths, unfortunately. Dog owners please take the legacies on the sidewalks with you!!"
22686,2564494,4,WilbyUK,30/01/2023,Full on 30th January and fully booked all week and on… Looked really nice but can’t comment on facilities - Not far from the sea so nice location. The receptionist told us that they had never seen it so busy. Just BE AWARE that all the campsites are fully booked in El Compello at the moment (we drove round all of them or called!).
22686,2563677,3,sougmi,29/01/2023,Small family campsite. Many campers come here to spend the winter. Helpful staff. Strongly shaded pitches (no catchment with satellite dish) except those located at the back of the campsite. The toilets are very clean and relatively new. Power line very unstable so not good for the operation of the fridge. 600 m from the seaside and 400 m from a very good bakery.
22686,2558581,3,lagouge,23/01/2023,It's abused paths and reduced parking piled up for 26.5€ per night it is better to go to the area

Immediately behind the area is a ""wasteland"" where it is good to walk the dogs. 900m to the beach. Grocery store 700m. Narrow spaces without parking in a big car. A big electricity bill surprised me when I checked out. The daily price includes 4 kwh of electricity and €0.46/kwh is paid for the excess part. Limitation max. 2 dogs. Lots of seasonal residents."

The minus point is that the pitches are not locked and sometimes you stand pretty close together although prices vary depending on the pitch (for us €33 including electricity, 2 people a van) and ours was not the cheapest. This longer way to the toilets."

It takes you 20 minutes to get to Alicante."
22686,1839230,3,Europatour2022,19/04/2022,"Hmm double figures. On the one hand, the sanitary facilities are great, but the pitches are very small and not really separated. For 35€ for 2 people plus van much too expensive for the fact that the beach is 1km away. WiFi great, but costs extra. We've been traveling Spain for a while and can appreciate what the place is worth."
22686,1783198,5,padraigl,14/03/2022,"Stayed here with our motorhome while family stayed in a bungalow. 
Some pitches are very tight to manoeuvre into. We had one off the main road which was perfect. 
The service bay is also tight and our 6.5m van just made the grey drain.
Water/ehu at each pitch and some pitches have a grey drain.
Showers are amazing with hot water anytime of day/night.
The staff were very friendly and helpful."
22686,1765644,1,fredletaz,25/02/2022,Not a campsite but a money factory. Places too small (thanks to our neighbor we were able to put the trailer on one end of its location). A tree in the drain area. Only 4Kw of electricity suddenly 15 euros more on the bill despite ACSI. Cold reception. only interest the tram to Alicante 10 minutes away. Go your way you will be as well in the surrounding areas.

Beautiful site with fantastic facilities, the shower / toilet blocks were cleaned numerous times throughout the day.

Pool on site but not open through winter. Definitely recommend this site."
