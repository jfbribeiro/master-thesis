87718,3111210,5,albablca,09/08/2023,"The best night of the trip without a doubt. We take the opportunity to watch the sunset eating pizzas. Beautiful place. Incredible views. The only fault that I put is to find the location. You don't get there from the route that Maps offers. We saw AC parked from afar and we were testing paths. There are some other critical moments to arrive since the ground is uneven, but otherwise... excellent."
87718,1214325,1,LauBert,23/05/2021,"The location cannot be found under the given coordinates. After a few difficult attempts that cost the Bulli quite a bit of clutch, we gave up and took the parking lot at the lighthouse."
87718,904215,5,jonyangulo,27/07/2020,Very calm night with spectacular views of the sea and the lighthouse.
87718,368587,5,Perci,09/09/2018,The entrance is a bit before this geolocation. You make a right down road for a little while. This spot is more for vans due to its rough terrain to get to the ocean. Do not be fooled by the dangerous beach signs. Your going the right way
87737,3244274,2,FurguiProl,01/09/2023,"Noise of cars and wind at the same time, at night it is a cruising point, since several men came in cars alone."
87737,2074271,3,olmuch,15/07/2022,"We ended up parking closer to the petrol station, opposite the water and air supply stations… as the spot for campers had 4 strange regular cars parking there and we were already coming in the middle of the night from a different place where someone broke into a car right next to us.. and it woke us up. So we didn’t want to relive that again. And down there all was ok. Toilet open all night"
87737,1890504,3,sanshaine74,14/05/2022,"Got to pay 1,20 for a van (cat2) to get in on the highway, but fairly quiet and clean despite,  McDonald’s and Lidl on the other side of the bridge. However, there was group of a few cars that kept coming back parking next to us and staring at us in a weird way all night long, we were under impression that we are on their way of some sort of dirty business going on. We left early morning."
87737,1743891,5,kero28,30/01/2022,"It's very good, you have to lagar 0.35 cents to enter, but it's very good you sleep well for a car but you have tables, the gasofa is close, ideal for spending the night and a Lidl nearby"
87742,3124460,5,Pierre05,11/08/2023,"Great spot between the water and the mountains. Access requiring that hearth driving wheels it is more comfort and rather small van? night with 4 curious cows, peaceful place."
87742,2355314,1,josepe1989,09/09/2022,"The lake is dry, don’t bother… maybe next yeqr."
87742,1332555,5,hollyandtom,17/07/2021,Absolutely excellent spot for wild camping! We originally only planned to sleep here but we spent a whole day there enjoying the lake which you have direct access to! There’s a great rock to jump off into the lake too. The road down is a little tricky but if you take it slow it’s ok! We were fine in our larger Campervan! Completely alone with nature apart from a few fishermen - no police!
87742,1052963,4,Flurpette21,16/09/2020,"Nice flat spot, more secluded than we thought. Great access to the lake for swimming. Unfortunately there’s a lot of trash here, so we had to clean up first.. Rocky dirt road to access can be a bit tricky, but if you go slowly it’s quite okay. Great view over the lake."
87742,372330,3,Lolo_2907,13/09/2018,"In early September the path is clearly too bad to go without a 4x4. In the early morning, there were two cars of locals, they were not afraid but saw the face of their cars. With the T4, I did not dare to venture. By cons, we parked upstairs and we went down on foot, the place is not too bad"
87742,370868,2,pij31,11/09/2018,"Path sloping and smashed to access, I did not dare go for fear of not going up with traffic, pity it looked nice"
87742,333196,5,dnl007,14/08/2018,"Very nice place where there are not many people. A little difficult to access but we managed with an old car. A little dirty but we picked up most of the trash, to do :)"
87762,722107,4,mattdbk,15/10/2019,We passed in heavy weight (8m30x2m35x3m60) but we were blocked further by a rut and the clay (rainy day) we finally got a little higher overlooking the lake
87762,486736,5,RatayTeam,18/05/2019,"Nice quiet place with flat ground. No mosquitoes, but it was a cool outside (15C before sun set). A little windy (not bad), so also good against bugs. It's a jeep trail, but 2wd ok if driver likes dirty roads."
87762,295457,4,freeridevan,21/07/2018,4 stars for mosquitoes
87785,2606305,1,AzucenaCampo,11/03/2023,"Only for emptying and filling water. It got dark and we stopped to sleep, many trucks with the engine running all night. Not recommendable"

87785,1938984,4,Jesika09,02/06/2022,Perfect for emptying water and filling. Not to sleep.
87785,579185,4,WorldByOurHomePL,27/07/2019,Good place to refill water and empty gray water.
87785,344210,1,Casita2,19/08/2018,"There is really only the greywater drain (a tap is there but you do not know if it's clean water or not, or if it's not used to cleaning cassettes occasionally. more to access it, it is by the motorway thus tolling without much interest."
87791,1624339,1,edelweiss86ct,03/10/2021,"Very narrow streets, not too bad for a van, but watch out for the slope. Dirty and full."
87791,1614942,1,Lourdesch,28/09/2021,"It is not a good option for a large motorhome, the streets are narrow and you can get a scare"
87796,3123858,5,karelenmarjan,11/08/2023,"What a paradise this campsite. The accessibility is fine if you just follow the road where the signs are. Hospitality at its best, great walks and shared meals were very cozy and delicious! Nice pool, relaxed atmosphere. Highly recommended! Not much to do in the area, just do your shopping on the way there."
87796,2749291,4,sjosjo89,14/05/2023,"It's really quiet here but we thought it was nice for 2 days. Environment is hilly but deserted, few cozy locations for a beer. If you want to relax, it's perfect with these nice Belgians. Road to stay is difficult but no problem with our bus camper, beautiful view once arrived! Midões extinct so you really have to go to Viseu, Coimbra for experience I think."
87796,2268247,5,LillyHealyMely,19/08/2022,"Lovely campsite, good to completely relax, nice dinner, lovely swimming pool, good showers and beautiful forest for walking."
87796,2264347,4,minililie,18/08/2022,"Nice place, quiet, clean. The swimming pool is superb. Lovely hosts. The kind of place that one hesitates to keep only for either… selfishly…"
87796,2232331,5,seboerema,13/08/2022,"We have been traveling 4 months in our van and this was one of the better campsites. At least when you love to swim, like forests, enjoy small campsites with much space and when the Belgium owners prepare meals for you. Maybe not as clean as it could be, but that is not an issue with all these advantages."
87796,2170553,1,FredGrapperhaus,03/08/2022,"No, not convenient to drive up here with a top-heavy camper. AJFgroenen is right. If you stop here, you shouldn't be surprised that your camper goes backwards down the mountain with 2 front locking wheels"
87796,1645433,4,chantalon,15/10/2021,"Very beautiful place, a very beautiful beautiful nature swimming pool of the very sympathetic owners, and what does not spoil a very good table with the products of the garden Access a little difficult big camper because abstain"

87810,1282006,5,Horchatilla,27/06/2021,We spent a very quiet night. There are no services but it is very much appreciated that they let us stay overnight. The next day we shopped at the supermarket to say thank you personally.
87814,1685688,1,alfredolathletic,11/11/2021,"This town is not Santa María la Real de Nievas, it is a district.... the town is approximately 5 km away."
87814,965039,1,JMSL,15/08/2020,"The town is quiet, we parked next to the church but the night was really bad because the neighbors get together to talk outside until the wee hours of the morning and then the kids throw a party outside in the summer until 5 in the morning. We haven't slept all night."
87834,3137306,5,sozalk,13/08/2023,"No case to the signal, something of 4 bitter that everything seems bad to them. To get there, go up from within the town, the other road is destroyed."
87834,2586864,4,EquipoFamilia,22/02/2023,Almost perfect for sleeping and following the path. The fountain does not work but 100m from the park there is another. Quiet and with space for children. Access by paved track with potholes.
87834,2199906,1,neo1,08/08/2022,Destroyed access road. Sign prohibiting camping. A shame :(
87834,1948761,1,AndreDhorizon,05/06/2022,there is a nice freshly placed sign prohibiting the parking of caravan and tent canvas. we are leaving again.
87834,1818114,5,BeaDui,13/04/2022,"We have spent two nights on two different trips and it is great. Comfortable and quiet. Just add that at the motorway exit (Pamplona direction) there are two restaurants, the one at the gas station is fine, but the one on the right when leaving the roundabout (El Ventorro) is for homemade food from the area, good, and good price. Do not leave any trace of your stay other than to improve the place. Health and miles!"
87834,1791631,3,Sjoberg,22/03/2022,"Nice place, but we had to leave because of the strong wind."

87834,440614,5,Chabourne,16/03/2019,"Super spot cemented, level. Quiet, beautiful view, near Autovia. The plateau could accommodate 4 or 5 motorhomes but limit to two to avoid invading this charming village."

87839,1365031,4,Diemate,25/07/2021,Despite the reviews we decided to stay the night and had no problem. The area has some noise but at midnight the silence was total. Highly recommended and also the views of the beach are unsurpassed. The parking lot is uneven.

87855,3188026,1,joanbaguer,20/08/2023,"The people who are installed all summer think that the place is theirs. We parked in a shady place and the neighbor of a motorhome made us very rude, saying that you could only park with an invitation... all a lie, a dirty ruse to have more space..."
87855,3088190,2,adriancrg94,06/08/2023,"We got there and it was packed. It seemed that most of the caravans spend the summer there, so there is little room for those who are passing through. We went a little further and we slept on the beachfront next to many vans, without taking anything out since it is a residential area."

87855,2372783,3,BELZANTI,15/09/2022,"Quiet place, a few permanent campers. The sea on the horizon, the pine forest on the other side. Gravelled but does not fear the rain. A trash can available at the entrance. Compared to other places in nature, I would say it's clean. Further down at about 300 m, there is a small supermarket, a bar and for romantic evenings, a beach bar, Lounge style."

87897,2749860,5,TaijaH,14/05/2023,We parked here for a day while visiting Gijon. It is close to beach promenade and within a walking distance to the city centre. There's also bicycle lanes in the beach promenade if someone prefers to bike instead. For overnight stays this might be noisy because of the road next to it.

87897,2436248,1,CristoyCarmen,10/10/2022,"Be careful in this car park, since it depends on who attends you they can scam you. We went to this car park to park the AC and be able to visit Gijón. Upon entering, the guy at the booth charged us €6, instead of €3 for being AC. When we returned from our visit we saw how they charged another AC €3. We asked another AC out of curiosity and they also charged €3. I do not recommend it"

87897,2122866,2,racingsant,25/07/2022,"The ticket office staff, specifically 2 girls, treated us very badly, because of what they said there are people who pay one day and then have to be behind so that they pay the rest of the days. And what does it matter to me, they complained about the motorhomes for no reason, I will not return, I'm sorry because it's supportive, but the rest of the motorhomes and campers are not to blame for what they do 4 without shame."

The only drawback is the Wi-Fi in the motorhomes, but that's the least of it when you have surrounding landscapes that invite you to be walking all day. we went for 4 days and we stayed 8. I see the price as reasonable. Heated shower and sink area."

This has caused me to spend the morning and not use the area."

The owner is pleasant and helpful. You have use of toilets and service area included but there is a charge for water and showers. Overall it’s really good value and a very short walk from the town. There busy road close by is quiet so it won’t disturb your sleep."
87966,2228162,4,titoteo,13/08/2022,"The area itself is very good, large squares, trees, and well-kept. The person who wears it is attentive. The small town. The price 12 euros, and 5 light, well, but the 4 euros per person in addition to the driver, is not logical. An area, it is not a campsite, they should charge per vehicle, and if anything for electricity."
87966,2191165,3,CristinaVoicu,07/08/2022,"Large campsites, not very quiet, showers are paid for, 2 euros for 3 minutes, but 2 showers work at the same time with the same token (2 people can enter each with one shower) electricity is not paid"
87966,2174697,3,Störti01,04/08/2022,"The reception was very nice. The place is spacious and there is a lot of love and work in it. The price of €12 plus €4 for the passenger is quite expensive. The shower also costs 2€ extra. The outdoor shower is really one. If you want to shower with spectators, this is the place for you."
87966,2173269,1,laperlaviajera,04/08/2022,"the spectacular site, but we did not stay, the manager or owner is not polite to the treatment and we left, in the middle of August there was only one motorhome. man would have a bad day."

87966,2069197,4,mamapeloti,13/07/2022,"The plots are very good because they are very large. The gentleman, as well as his way of charging are very peculiar. In July to €12 you have to add €4 more per person other than the driver. The showers are separate. Clean bathrooms. sinks. It lets you use an outdoor shower to freshen you up."
87966,2060205,5,FamiliaGT,11/07/2022,"We love this site. Very close to the historic center (less than 10 minutes). It has a lot of charm and details (playground area, outdoor shower for the heat, picnic areas). Well leveled pitches with some shade.

87966,1910970,2,Joserram,23/05/2022,"The best, the plots, large, well placed and with well-kept lawns. The theme of the services is sad, they are WC booths from the works. For washing up there are only 2 sinks and for washing clothes there are none. The price €17 with current I see it extremely expensive. As well as showers at €2 x 5 minutes, very expensive. The town of Lerma, and especially its old city, beautiful."

We arrived at 5:20 p.m. and there was no one there, we went in to see if we could find it and on the bulletin board a thousand and one handwritten notes from the owner giving guidelines on how to act. The barracks of the bathrooms closed (note to the song) and the one of the shower at this moment was mixed and with its pertinent note d €2-5'."

This time because the Toledo campsite where I was closed without warning because the prefecture would have forced the closure because of Covid 19. I called this private service area and it opened without problems. Only worries, 280 km of Toledo. The reception is perfect, the same place and the price more than reasonable, the same for one or more occupants in the vehicle. Shops 400 meters on foot. I highly recommend."

Only us here which is a shame as the site is very secure with big metal gates and the gentleman was very helpful. 5 min walk into Lerma with bars and tavernas and a supermarket. Dog friendly . Only down side as said above is the motorway noise but the proximity to the motorway is great for a stop off . Could probably spend a day round Lerma too as it seems quite pretty. Will definitely use again on our travels down to Spain"

87968,1643768,5,GuillermoS.,14/10/2021,"Access road somewhat stony, when I came it had formed a puddle before accessing the area closest to the sea. If it is, go slowly, there are stones. An excellent place, but like many others, on weekends and holidays, people come at sunset. It is a transit area on foot since there is a route that connects several beaches. I spent one night without any problems. Highly recommended."

I still agree with the other comments pay attention to your waste I understand that wild camping is badly perceived when I see the state in which you leave the spots. No wonder we are poorly received by the locals."
87968,1465254,3,unomas,16/08/2021,"The site is beautiful, but I would not be surprised that in a short time we will be prohibited from accessing it. It is not acceptable that the rock is taking tables and chairs next to the vans and ac-s. Then we complain that there are more and more banned sites. This is not a campsite. In the end they will screw us all, for a few."
87968,1449071,5,balaperdids,13/08/2021,"Super quiet place. It is past a small bar that has an exclusive parking for them. We have slept with campers and A / C, and no problem. It has a small beach right next to it, where we saw the star shower."
87968,1439203,3,Madarixa,11/08/2021,"Nice place, but a lot of cars come to the streets and watch the sun go down. Many park poorly and obstruct the entrance to the parking lot. Last night two caravans could not get out. We slept higher just in case. Many cars come to watch the sunset and many park poorly. Yesterday two caravans could not leave the parking lot. We have slept a little higher"

87968,1226158,5,FuXerxes,30/05/2021,"We stood here for two nights and were absolutely satisfied. At the weekend you should arrive either early or late, otherwise it will be impossible to get a parking space, this place is very popular. You are right on the beach and can enjoy a very beautiful sunset from there. There is a nice hiking trail and rocks to climb. Apart from a garbage can, no service."
87968,1214738,3,DamdamMarinouille,24/05/2021,"It's parking, not an isolated place, so it gets crowded. On the other hand, it's very good for the night, quiet, and the beach is beautiful"
87968,1213565,4,pive,23/05/2021,"Beautiful beaches with sunset views. On the weekends a lot of people come to take a walk, can get a bit crowded especially in the afternoon and evening. Also, no camping behavior allowed - park sheriff came and warned campers to remove tables and chairs."
87968,1174372,5,MicSimo,16/04/2021,"Beautiful place to sleep by the sea, we stayed there 2 nights. Just beware of a few potholes along the way, but the view is really worth it. Obviously it is not perfectly flat, convenient for taking the walk to Praia castineria and Praia do Carrero. During the day, some fishermen's cars arrive, but never many."
87968,1060561,4,Marypk,20/09/2020,"Very quiet place. It has a small beach and a great promenade next to the sea. A wonderful sunset. We slept next to 3 AC and 2 vans without problem. In the morning the civil guard passed by and said nothing to us. No services, just to throw out the garbage."

87968,950187,4,Chiki84,11/08/2020,"Incredible views. It is a sand and gravel parking lot next to the beach, without services and two small garbage cans (please, each one take your garbage). Although there is a sign forbidden ""Camping and caravans"", the Civil Guard allows it as long as chairs, tables, all are not taken out. As always there are a few who ignore it and think it is a Camping. In the end they will ban it. RESPECT"
87968,949544,4,withourhymer,11/08/2020,"Nice place. Quiet, next to the beach and views of the sunset. Two things: Narrow access road. You have to respect the rules and the environment. There are two small garbage cans, we cannot fill them and leave the lids open or the animals will scavenge our garbage. There is to throw the garbage in another place, avoid smoking and throwing cigarette butts ... We have to clean, not dirty."
87968,891124,5,duncantw,23/07/2020,"Precious site. I only ask that if you see a small container in a remote place like this, the one you are leaving, do not leave the garbage bag. Wait to leave it in a bigger one. Those details are what throw us out of spectacular places and restrict access more and more."
87968,858938,5,JoseASV,10/07/2020,"Perfect place. Many coves in the area and few people, the flat and sandy parking, but you are practically on the beach. I have done all the Galician coast and I think I will keep that place. It is a wonder"

88205,2923120,4,Gui_Chaves,04/07/2023,"Despite being full, there are spaces on the side. The night is very difficult, due to the intense traffic on the avenue. TIP: when crossing the walkway to the other side of the street, you will find Shopping Continente with air conditioning, many clean bathrooms and in the food court you can work and use free wi-fi indefinitely. We only left the city due to the lack of ASA. It's almost impossible to go through Portimão."

88205,2332880,2,Burgaillo,02/09/2022,"Sites like this are cool. Parking for 5 spaces, fair in width and long in length. the road next to it. Noise and more noise, in short, a championship kk to sleep, of course. I was from Friday to Saturday"
88205,2323257,4,parknight1731,30/08/2022,Very good for visiting the city. 30 minutes walk from Praia Da Rocha. We didn't spend the night but it must be ok

88205,2265268,4,ibeasko90,19/08/2022,There are 5 sites for ACs but we were another 5-6 more. The site at night and until 8am is quiet. Until 00-1 traffic noise. Lidl has put laundry in the parking lot itself. Attached to LIDL is FeuVert. To the center (promenade) 20 minutes walk. Thank you LIDL.
88205,2264828,5,cristianzz,19/08/2022,"Perfect for overnight. Not a single noise all night, we were several AC and campers. Point in favor of having the bathrooms of the supermarket so close."
88205,2261989,4,alvarocece,18/08/2022,Good place to sleep. We stayed one night along with other motorhomes and vans. It has no services but across the road (pedestrian bridge) there is a Continente shopping center with free services.
88205,2261867,4,svencamper123,18/08/2022,"Good spot for one night, you have to walk around 35min to get to the beach. Lidl has a very clean public toilet that opens at 8:00h. You can also find laundry at the lidl parking spot."

88205,2222802,5,axlt5,12/08/2022,"The site was very good, you could reach the port on foot in 20 minutes and 30 minutes from Rochas beach, we walked and it was fine. Lidl toilets were very nice and clean. We spent 1 night and we were like 10 motorhomes."
88205,2190659,4,imlsaman,07/08/2022,It has 4 large places to leave the caravan and spend the night. No services. At night the site can be noisy due to traffic.
88205,2189244,4,Lisi1701,07/08/2022,"Spent one night here. Lidl has a toilet that is clean and you can use it until 11pm. From here it is a 20-minute walk to the sardine festival. Street quite noisy, but perfectly ok for one night."
88205,2127567,3,Nicosandrine,26/07/2022,"We spent one night there. ideal for discovering the city and the beach. Passing all night, quite noisy, but has the merit of existing."
88205,2054573,4,CHARLESKING,09/07/2022,We spend the day to visit Portimão without spending the night. Correct site without services.

88205,2035996,5,Migueaxn,04/07/2022,Very large car parks with practically no slope. A bit noisy as it is next to a main avenue. There are washing machines (€5 for 8 kilos and €10 for 18 kilos). It is a 20-minute walk from La Rocha beach.
88205,1987483,4,Roxana76,18/06/2022,"Special parking for motorhomes provided by Lidl, the spaces are very large (4), we have slept very well, only a little noise until dawn. Totally recommended."

We only spent two hours there."

88205,570347,1,Destinea,23/07/2019,I do not recommend. We didn't spend the night there because around 9:45 pm someone threw a rock and broke a window at me. Lidl's surveillance cameras were useless and the police did nothing. We are definitely NOT going back.
88205,460608,4,merchecampayo,20/04/2019,"A very good parking for parking and overnight, with supermarkets, Mac Donald, shopping center. .About 15 m from the center."

88209,2835162,3,TimF,09/06/2023,Fairly flat. We used top entrance because it was flatter to get in and out. Sadly cars doing doughnuts at 5am
88209,1335127,4,sevorane,18/07/2021,"The place is not bad, and a parking lot and sand is quite flat but there is nothing and shade. The center is within walking distance and according to another colleague we spoke with, it is very good to sleep since in the port on weekends They make a bottle and that's why they were there."
88209,1063297,4,HawaianosFamily,21/09/2020,It is a fairly flat and dirt parking lot. it is very spacious. About 15 minutes walk from the beach and the promenade. We were sleeping on a Saturday and the night was very quiet
88241,492089,2,Mojito125,25/05/2019,"We parked there to walk on the beach. We were 3 motorhomes but we did not sleep, this street is very busy."
88244,3212351,5,sardz1,24/08/2023,Good campsite with sea view on some pitches. There is shade depending on location and time. They have now made 1 small swimming pool at the entrance of the campsite + 1 paddling pool. The campsite restaurant is excellent. The Spar and the beach are 3min walk and the city center is 5min. Only downside the showers deserve to be redone and the nights are expensive in season 45 € / night without electricity
88244,3165196,5,Jocbs64,17/08/2023,Perfect van plot! With a very nice view of the sea and a quiet and very natural place! Close to the beach and the center! Two perfect nights!
88244,3090900,2,Rocega,06/08/2023,"For motorhomes, very improvable... Depending on who... You may not feel very well received. It can be difficult to park, as it is on a hillside. There are other campsites, on other nearby beaches, with better value for money."
88244,3078677,1,gerardcp47,05/08/2023,"Plot 130 with a serious ant infestation, one thing is that they say it is normal for there to be in the area we are in, another is that at 2 o'clock you have to run to look for an insecticide spray because your van is the M40 of the ants. (1 week later I continue killing and removing ants that we don't even know where they come from) Nothing like this had happened to us in 12 years."
88244,3060171,3,oliverannuss,01/08/2023,46€ van 2 people without electricity. Still cheap around here. Place looks extremely crowded. There is no straight place. The place looks nice but completely tourist crowded…

88244,2731015,5,Lady007,07/05/2023,ideal for visiting Palafruguell...5 mins walk from the town and the beach...very clean toilets...quiet nights...vehicle safe...
88244,2677602,5,quadfan,17/04/2023,A favourite Spanish campsite for us. Wonderful views. Facilities are good and clean but don't expect tiled bathrooms etc. Very helpful owners. Very handy for the town and beach.
88244,2677408,5,barbatruc33,17/04/2023,"a very nice campsite in a very nice place! the toilets are very beautiful which is not trivial! we were under the tied oaks, at the cam. we took advantage of the places out of season, without many people, which is certainly no longer the case in summer! indeed the village is small and there must be a crazy crowd. thank you for the particularly friendly welcome!"
88244,2661815,4,wimdemo,11/04/2023,"A nice campsite for spring with beautiful cork oaks and lots of shade. plumbing has many leaking taps, and few locks on toilet doors. Showers too hot, sometimes too cold. Difficult to arrange. Before the start of the season, this would feel better if this was all fixed. Ideal location for the center and the beach. Shop with bread at 5 min walk."
88244,2659156,2,neeusi,10/04/2023,plot that did not even see the sea. All climbs and stairs. There was no hot water to wash the dishes. The road is quite audible
88244,2653816,5,Dodic,09/04/2023,"A privileged place, things like said roads can always be improved, but the site is unbeatable"
88244,2651589,3,VanArJo,08/04/2023,"Very welcoming staff. Very tight pitches and trees in the middle of the plots. Clean sanitary facilities but old-fashioned taps Alternating iced water, hot water or no water! Organized on a terrace, lots of stairs. Situation ok Restaurant at the entrance. (very) small swimming pool. Nice views, you can guess the sea in the distance. (very far) A van van 2 adults 32 euros including 10% reduction if ACSI."

88244,2474947,3,MartKuijpers,31/10/2022,"Great location and prime location on the bay. . With a large camper of 7.5 meters, it is careful maneuvering! The sanitary facilities, especially showers, are no longer of this time and accommodation. Friendly reception. Wonderfully quiet now at the end of October."
88244,2469913,4,BARRIEREPhilippe,29/10/2022,very well placed. we were lucky to have had 1 spacious sea view pitch with a beautiful terrace. the sanitary facilities are actually a little dilapidated but very clean. we will return
88244,2466506,5,Matze.293,28/10/2022,"Top friendly owner, very clean sanitary facilities and supermarket right around the corner. Quite narrow but rewarding driveway: most pitches with sea views"
88244,2462674,5,apachi96,26/10/2022,"We had an excellent pitch with a direct sea view. 22,72€ per night, very fast wifi, old but clean sanitary facilities, pool and a friendly host! The only campsite in callela that was still open at the end of october. In October we could also book for one night."
88244,2458133,3,Mangos,23/10/2022,"Were there off-season, so had a pleasant, quiet night. Toilets and showers old but functional. It would be a nice place if you love something and invest money."
88244,2456011,4,D_O_C,22/10/2022,"Very pleasant campsite, good location for the beach and for restaurants and Spar supermarket. Some places on the street a bit noisy, some very uneven. Very friendly welcome, speak good English. Sanitary facilities a bit old, but sparkling clean. Electricity. Connection adventurous, renounced! Fresh water at almost every pitch. Not too expensive in October at €20 ACSI. dream place!!!"
88244,2430363,5,ccbuchn,08/10/2022,"This place was amazing we would stay her again! The owners are fantastic, facilities were clean and wonderful. 21 € for us and 7 more for electric. Beach near by is so lovely! Would 10/10 recommend."
88244,2368595,1,anniflo,13/09/2022,"First of all the price of camping is exorbitant! €33.82 per day and WITHOUT ELECTRICITY! In the month of September ! the benefits are not worth the price at all! The toilets are old, the showers are cramped and several do not work. The pitches are tiny, the pool is really of a very moderate size and the sea view is actually seen on the road. To flee !!"
88244,2333224,3,Jere,02/09/2022,Either the discount link for this app doesn't work or they mess around at the front desk!
88244,2285726,3,ideatika,22/08/2022,"Well priced to be in the heart of the Costa Brava and for the location. Close to a supermarket, the town, the coves and the Camí de Ronda. The bathrooms are very basic. Lots of ants. Normally it is a very quiet campsite with basic services, it does not have a super inside and the pool is small."
88244,2281924,1,juanjograhu,21/08/2022,"Very old campsite, it is a labyrinth, it took us 2 hours to be able to settle because there was a vehicle due to the confusion of distribution of plots, many ants, NOT SUITABLE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, there is no lighting of the paths at night, the pool and solarium area typical of a chalet, expensive for what it offers, better the Tamariu campsite in the next town and visit Calella."
88244,2264195,2,northcraftervan,18/08/2022,"A 10 in location, since it is 5 minutes from downtown and beaches. But what camping is…like canned sardines, a small and sloping plot, the pool as if it were private, and the exorbitant price even in August."
88244,2138765,1,nicolaskelly,29/07/2022,"It is a campsite and not a motorhome area. very expensive in high season for a motorhome with 5 people for 2 nights on July 26 and 27 €126. small pitch difficult to access, full of ants and no electricity on the pitch even with my 2 extension cords impossible to reach the electrical box . Also do not eat at the small expensive restaurant even the bread and on the bill"
88244,2119161,2,mariona55,25/07/2022,"The location is very good but we did not like the camping. Very old facilities and above all many, many ants. There is no separation of plots, which can be chaotic"
88244,2067549,3,sofia24,13/07/2022,"Camping ok. Unfortunately we have had a bad experience with ants, as we have been invaded by them, as have our neighbors! The camping staff promptly used a poison, which, however, only gave a remedy for a short time. We had ants both externally and internally. It took us a whole morning to get rid of all the ants. So be careful!"
88244,2018546,4,ilonaroll,28/06/2022,"Simple, near-natural campsite with old trees. At the beginning of the Spanish holiday, at the end of June, pleasantly quiet, clearly occupied. For us, with a motorhome 7.4m, it is quite feasible, for larger vehicles, through the trees, rather not suitable, in my opinion. We made a stopover here and can certainly imagine a longer stay."
88244,1997380,4,bertdk,21/06/2022,"good location, close to shops and center. many pieces with grass so no dusty lot. View of the sea through the trees. sanitary and swimming pool could be renewed..."
88244,1975614,5,soizic22,14/06/2022,very well located campsite..near the beaches...sanitary facilities of exemplary cleanliness...friendly and attentive staff. campsite with espalier pitches.. so it goes up. but no problem. we had a sea view from our location.
88244,1947254,5,chikispoon,05/06/2022,"For me, a good campsite, with the basics and clean, is close to the beach. Some plots are small, but if you request it in advance they do everything possible to offer you a suitable plot for your needs. Very friendly staff. Surely there are campsites better but for me and what I am looking for with this one I have more than enough and it is enough for me."
88244,1941343,1,Ligia291,03/06/2022,"The worst experience we have had, I do not recommend this campsite, expensive 33 euros without electricity, obsolete, difficult to navigate and maneuver with motorhomes, a labyrinth inside, to empty on a slope, we almost had to ask for a crane to get out."
88244,1940292,1,LosNanos,02/06/2022,"It is not a payment area as the icon reflects, it is a Camping. The price per night for AC and 2 people was €33.62 and if you wanted electricity, another €5 more, ""A robbery"". The campsite is obsolete, the accesses are poor and many of them are dirt roads with a steep slope and the ACs of more than 7m slip. The unloading area has a slope, difficult to overcome if it is front-wheel drive. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!"
88244,1940242,1,KaneloAntonio,02/06/2022,"It is not an area, it is a campsite not suitable for a motorhome, many slopes, bad asphalt, abandonment of cleaning, very expensive, €36 a day without light in the place to dump Grices, I get stuck because of the slope that it has, the motorhome did not work out for me, not recommended"
88244,1936541,5,lalero,01/06/2022,"I put 5 stars for the friendliness. neglect in the plots, with water intake but dirt floor and remains of dry trees. Very little grassy area in certain tent pitches. Access is tricky and sloping. The great pool, the descent and ascent to the beach with a steep slope of about 15 minutes, the cove and the beach are impressive for that alone, it is worth €22 ac plus two people"
88244,1934269,5,kingsbridge2,31/05/2022,My first review after 3 years and around 300 campsites I felt the urge to review this campsite in my opinion one of the nicest that we have visited yes it’s not easy to negotiate your place but once parked it was delightful Both Wilma and George the owners were both charming the restaurant served authentic Spanish food and the little town absolutely lovely
88244,1928211,2,angoitia,29/05/2022,very expensive. it is not worth paying so much for what it offers
88244,1850334,2,auvergne,24/04/2022,"It's a campsite, pitches too steep too expensive out of season only positive point near the sea"
88244,1830760,2,Wolfgang.wuerz,17/04/2022,"In and of itself a nice location for a campsite. But the shape of the terrace also causes problems. The upper part can only be reached through a tunnel. Many pitches are useless because they are very uneven, too small, or trees, or the neighbor has no space either. the place is simply too expensive for what is on offer in mid-April 62 euros for two days despite the discount is simply too much."
88244,1808714,4,bernbea,06/04/2022,The restaurant on the square is highly recommended. Very friendly service and remarkably good food. Price for one night 27 euros/LS inclusive. current
88244,1668399,1,Nelma,29/10/2021,"Central campsite, everything else abandoned, the toilets and showers upstairs smelled like a sewer, the gray and poti dump area was totally dirty and abandoned, apart from difficult to access. And they charge as if it were luxury € 28 / day for Ac and two people, in low season (late October)."
88244,1665757,5,capalita,28/10/2021,"Very nice home. beautiful and large campsite, very clean and open all year round."

88244,1586197,4,Casiopaier,17/09/2021,"Very cozy camping site with a great location right in the village. Everything can be reached on foot in 5 minutes. The site has charming pitches with electricity / water and WiFi everywhere. Unfortunately, the restaurant was already closed because we were outside of the session. The sanitary facilities are older but not dirty! The pool is new and well worth a visit. We will be back!"

88244,1525123,2,DaniAw,28/08/2021,"Excellent location. And very good service attention ... But ... a week after we left (we stayed two nights), we continued to remove ants from the motorhome. I understand that it is part of the ecosystem, but they should take measures such as warning you, spraying you or using some repellent as soon as you arrive (they did it when we complained). I would not repeat for the ants ... a pass !!!"
88244,1519336,1,txap,27/08/2021,"Good location (it's the only good thing it has), the campsite is a labyrinth, they don't provide a map, they tell you to take a picture with your mobile of the map at reception. We were at the top and there was no noise, but the campsite is very neglected, the bathrooms are old and without hot water. Small pool, dirty and hot water. All this and the price it has ... I will neither return nor recommend it"
88244,1494801,2,ladragona,22/08/2021,"The only good thing is the location, near the center and beach. Old facilities, tiny pool. Very noisy at night, people do not respect silence after 12 and parties."
88244,1484758,2,JonAA,20/08/2021,"Don’t expect any wonders: no hot water in the showers, messy plots, a bit of dirty pool water. It is not convenient to move with AC. On the other hand, very good location, two minutes from the beach and the center. Even without a reservation, there is room for two nights in mid-August."
88244,1460219,3,izas1976,15/08/2021,"The best location a few meters from the center and the beach. Quiet at night (we were on top). By cons, labyrinth camping, outdated bathrooms and cold water in the showers, and difficult access from the inside. Very small pools."
88244,1452532,1,Sorifer90,13/08/2021,"Bad reception, no explanations and information. Pitches in terrible condition, neither clean nor leveled. Old campsite without renovation, for what they charge they should. Excessively small pool. The campsite is a labyrinth and without directions. Very complicated access to the loading and emptying area. Ants everywhere, they get inside. There is no hot water in the showers. Nothing recommendable."
88244,1448129,1,maixu,13/08/2021,"Although we made the reservation online several days in advance indicating a motorhome from 6 to 8 meters, when we arrived there was no pitch that could fit our Ac that measures 7.3 meters. It is a campsite with many slopes, we hit several times in the low, of terrain and irregular plots with trees in between. I think there are still 4-5 places that are used for AC but in general it is not a camping adapted to AC. If you are going to camp or with a small van, it is still worth it but if not, I do not see it. Nor do I see it for small children a lot of stairs and it costs. I found two other people, one with an equipped van and the other with a caravan who were not comfortable either. On their behalf, very friendly staff, they apologized saying that it was a campsite from 60 years ago and they returned my money. We went somewhere else"
88244,1447794,2,gonmirsi,12/08/2021,"Very noisy at night because there is a pizzeria next door and there is a party every night until dawn and nobody does anything even though we have complained. We have not slept at all. Old facilities. The owner and staff are very attentive. Small pools. In August I advise against it, too touristy place. Too many people and not a pin can enter the beaches."
88244,1443593,2,JoaquinyEva,12/08/2021,"We hired 2 nights, the first night without problems the plot was large, in the morning we did tourism, when they saw the empty plot they assigned it to other people, they did not have more plots and they put us in another but we could not fit, we could not even take out a chair. It is very noisy, it crosses a road in the middle, there are tourist apartments and a night party. I would not recommend it for motorhomes."

Very pleasant campsite, shaded lots of people but very quiet no noise at night, the toilets are very clean the Covid measures are well respected .Supermarket next door and coves 5 minutes walk from crystal clear water. Very pretty typical village with its fish restaurants"
88244,1410458,5,alfredoip,05/08/2021,Very well located. A few meters from the beach. Good treatment of the people who run it. In the restaurant of the campsite you can eat well and at a reasonable price.
88244,1409392,2,correkaminos,05/08/2021,"With large motorhomes it is not highly recommended, to throw the gray ones you put the motorhome badly, very old and dirty facilities, some sloping squares, we did not like it and we will not return, the only positive is its location nothing more."

For the rest, the showers and clean bathrooms seemed to be a correct campsite. There are cheaper camping."

88244,1268258,3,abeccas,21/06/2021,"How camping is fine, as a motorhome area it is quite a disaster. They have not tried to improve their services for motorhomes and therefore it is very difficult to drive inside with those vehicles. If it were not because more than one annoyed the motorhome, the services would be a joke Of grays and blacks, see it to believe it. It has a pool and is close to the town, which is nice. expensive without the offer"

We have been at the top of the campsite, where it is the most sunny. Very nice atmosphere, very clean bathrooms, swimming pool available. Very attentive treatment, they left us an extension when we did not reach the power point, but be patient with the queue that usually has at reception.

Quite a few people go to watch the sunset and then leave, so I recommend arriving but, if you don't have a very “ideal” place, wait before setting up everything in case another more cool one becomes free. With bathrooms (no shower) although they are closed at night (around 11pm?). Very calm. Away from the hustle and bustle of the city but 5 min by car. We will be back!!"

88267,3014090,4,RiCo7078,24/07/2023,"We slept two nights. Space very illuminated at night. There are no containers, just some trash. Better to use the ones on the way to the port or the parking lot halfway to the AC area. A major drawback of the Portiño area is the distance to the bus stop (line 3 or 3A) at the top, next to the transformers, which take you to the Riazor beach, Torre de Hércules or the center for €1.30"

88267,1708406,5,Ikarus_90,11/12/2021,"It must be said that the views are fabulous, we were there one night and it is not wasted. One feels insignificant watching the breaking of the waves and the landscape of this place. The gray water and the water load is done a little lower, in an area prepared for it.

When the sun goes down until well into the night there are still mosquitoes. Use a mosquito net in the van, otherwise they enter and there are many."
88329,2398514,4,ricycon,24/09/2022,"Perfect for one night, and if you are a beach lover, for more days. In September there were no longer any beach bars, there were only two left, at first. so noise was not a problem, nor was space, since you could choose. Without services, and with a height limit of 2.20. There are comments that say that the gauge can be avoided, but we don't look at it."

The only bad thing is that at night some young people pass by and cause a bit of noise. Nothing was stolen from us. Upon seeing the comment of the robbery, we removed all our valuables from the cabin and slept with the door open to ventilate."
88329,1243266,1,LTM_84,08/06/2021,We got ROBBED while we were sleeping inside. The windows were slightly open because of hot night they got in that way. Police confirmed these thefts are common. Even during daytime.

I was there in mid-October. there are several campers. if it does not feel right for the night, you can find a parking spot for the night on asphalt 20 meters back. All parking machines are closed in October. So spend the night !!!"

Stay maybe only allowed (or chargeable?) from 11.00 until 19.00 and bathing is not allowed (please respect).

88380,1353141,5,jcrudele,23/07/2021,A beautiful pool to bathe and enjoy. Access is somewhat difficult but I went with a 7.40-hour motorhome and had no problems. The only pity is that there is a sign right when entering the place that says it is forbidden to spend the night and camp. With great regret we decided not to stay the night.

88380,552866,5,pacoaga,14/07/2019,Very quiet place to spend the night. Normally there are people from the town. we spend the night alone in a berlingo and two dogs. Be careful to leave the trash hanging out of the van. That a fox came to bother us at night :) On the road 4 kilometers before arriving you have a fountain where you can recharge water. if not directly in the toll de vidre.
88380,461993,3,Xupi8,21/04/2019,Beautiful place and very quiet. It only has one drawback and that is that when we went on the dirt road it had some stretch with access difficulties.
88388,2857708,3,guaito,15/06/2023,"EXTENSION OF RESTRICTIONS: Motor vehicles prohibited from 01:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. from June 1 to October 15, 2023. The Forest Ranger has requested dissemination. Next year the ban will be twelve months (2024). This measure has been taken due to abuse when parking and installing tables, awnings, etc. A pity, the idea was to enable an area with all the services. Civil Guard fine in the morning."
