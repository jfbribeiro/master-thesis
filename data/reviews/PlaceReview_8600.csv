111188,3175518,2,jps35,18/08/2023,Own. 1 place in the shade possibly another half. But not very pleasant place: many trucks on the nearby road. We didn't stay.
111188,3116070,5,Pioyu,10/08/2023,Thanks to the Caspe City Council. A good place to recharge and empty (for free). It is an enclosure with few but spacious squares. For a stopover or to sleep 1 day. Food stores 10 minutes walk.
111188,3096801,4,markjane49,07/08/2023,Big thanks to the town for providing these facilities. Close to all the things you need to see and do. Clean and well maintained. If only the UK could join in.
111188,2849720,5,JimWilson,13/06/2023,"Great stop to empty & refill water. Bicycle repair area with tools, pump etc. Picnic table and bin. Has everything you need . Muchas gracias Caspe."
111188,2778973,3,AnaDegax,23/05/2023,"Tiptoper parking space, flat, drain point not far. 3 stars because the view is not that great and Caspe is not really worth seeing except for the Torre Salamanca..."
111188,2778795,3,HectorHoose,23/05/2023,New Aire with perfect service point.
111188,2778443,2,Aloys52686,23/05/2023,"Moderate, in the city on a busy road (during the day) bare. We will not stand here. By the way, the coordinates are wrong. N41. 228843 E0.03. (rest I don't know)"

111188,2679304,4,Perot,18/04/2023,"A good place to spend the night and visit the town. The road is right next to it but there is hardly any traffic. Some earplugs can fix it. In a previous comment I have seen that they give it only one star because the user did not like it. Opinions cannot be based on ""my taste"". The stars have to be awarded based on the quality of the area and this is perfect."
111188,2659978,4,Remolin,10/04/2023,"Area near the center of Caspe. Although the road passes by, the night is very quiet because there is hardly any traffic"
111188,2643718,1,catetphiphi50,06/04/2023,we did not stay in this car park too far from the sea of arrogance preferred the car park near the nautical center and the bar for the view and the calm
111188,2633306,4,ReinerReisdorf,01/04/2023,"Good and safe place to stay, with supply and disposal. Just a stone's throw from the castle and a walk into town. Drum and trombones removed from 8-10pm due to Holy Week but didn't bother us."
111188,2595619,4,elainetimstravels,02/03/2023,Stayed on route to  Zaragoza. Good clean  little site & only short walk into town. Grocery shops within walking distance. Quite generally overnight except for us we chose a night when their town festival was on & you could hear the base of music till early hours.
111188,2578039,4,gg13013,14/02/2023,Recent sunny area. The road can be noisy on weekdays because of trucks. The city has a rich heritage that is worth the detour.
111188,2559206,4,Marylene_49,24/01/2023,Thank you to the city for this motorhome area. ... the services are free and clean ...
111188,2537955,4,KarolineKompany,02/01/2023,"The area is fine, it even has a point for bicycles. Only 1 picnic table right next to the empties. Wide and level squares. The downside is that it is next to the road and there is a lot of noise from trucks and cars, we did not spend the night. For the rest, everything is fine, there is plenty of possibility in a side and is fenced. A walk to the town."
111188,2503377,5,APLt5,23/11/2022,"Very well-kept area, totally level, with some shade and illuminated at night. Clean and accessible emptying and filling area. We have spent a quiet night. Thanks to the City Council for investing in this type of tourism!"

111188,2278046,3,guau,21/08/2022,We had a very good night on August 5. The road is next to it but at night not very busy. We had a drink around the town and there was quite an atmosphere.
111188,2037481,4,timourrou,04/07/2022,nice clean area with all services except electricity. 15 minutes from the city center

111188,1951905,4,pablolarri,06/06/2022,"Good place to visit Caspe. The night is spent well, during the day the proximity of the highway makes it very noisy. Very clean and shady."
111188,1882416,2,jamigui,10/05/2022,"a recent, clean area with delimited but generous pitches. The only but big problem is traffic noise because it's the road to Tarragona that passes there...with a lot of heavy goods vehicles from 5 a.m....to be avoided if you want to sleep well"
111188,1837327,5,eedu93,19/04/2022,"Everything clean, flat, quiet, and the area seems quite new. He walks to the town in a little walk"

111188,1748104,5,vikiub,05/02/2022,"the area is perfect and above all it is free, a fact for which the users of these areas have no interest in keeping it clean... I say this because someone has not bothered to lift the lid of the space intended for empty the poti and has emptied everything in the drain of the filler tap leaving everything full of poop and paper on top of the grid."
111188,1742075,5,FernandoNuez,27/01/2022,"fantastic area everything is phenomenal even tools and air pump has, now it's time to take care of it together, thank you very much to the city of Caspe and especially to its Mayor............."
111188,1716558,4,dwk262,27/12/2021,"We stopped for the night thanks to the comments of others. What to say about this area, you have to leave the garbage, discharge of gray water and toilet (poorly marked but it is understood), clean water and information on Caspe. On the other hand, it is next to the road and that means that if you are a light sleeper you can wake up but in general it is very good to spend the night. Attached photos"

111188,1703873,3,caracola17,05/12/2021,"Correct area with all services and clean, next to a road. The town without any charm in my humble opinion and the heritage that it has very neglected, a real shame indeed."
111188,1694926,5,furgo_negreta,21/11/2021,"A thousand thanks to the City of Caspe for the initiative. Let's all keep it clean. We had a very quiet night. With free services in the area. Large town with history. I recommend visiting the center. Hiking and mountain biking routes. To put one downside, it is next to the road and in the morning the cars are heard. We will repeat."
111188,1641795,5,casot,12/10/2021,"Impeccable area, large squares, with water intakes and gray and black water drains. ideal for visiting the town with a walk of about 15 minutes. Thanks to the City of Caspe for this initiative."
111188,1608326,5,JeMaMarlin,25/09/2021,"A good place to spend the night, quiet near the center of town. In midsummer there would be a few more shades missing."

111188,1130998,4,Davidolas,16/01/2021,"Comfortable, new, paved, leveled, quiet, all very well. Too bad that to sleep with the road next to it, I don't think you are very comfortable. We are not going to check it. Although with this Covid, not many cars pass ....."
111188,1100509,1,dodege,20/10/2020,"To sleep ... to avoid, at the edge of the busy road, a lot of truck traffic, tractors and cars Too bad, but thank you for the service."

111188,1036290,5,byajhl,09/09/2020,"A great area, away from the center but like so many others. Flat, asphalt, with gray and black drain, filled ... it's great, a 10 for the Caspe town hall. We will be back."
111188,1021936,5,javisonrie7,02/09/2020,Extraordinary area !! In the village there is an adidas store and the sweets from their bakeries are brutal. The swamp is beautiful and you can rent boats

111188,490217,1,avera,22/05/2019,"My vision of the nightmare as a stop. Small surface, asphalted, sites delicately bounded on the ground and a beautiful fence to 'separate' from the main road which passes in front. Not seen tree. Sinister surroundings. We did not even stop, the tastes and colors ..."

111188,465992,4,XJR1300YAM,24/04/2019,"The area still smells of fresh tar. The bins overflow. To wash the motorhome, it is 200 m further on on the left. There is no footbridge to wash the roof."

111188,462748,5,Pasitos,21/04/2019,05/21/19 Perfectly asphalted. Only the lines that delimit the car parks are missing.

111188,437112,3,leptitjp,06/03/2019,"3 stars, just for the merit of existing and continue the work. But at 2 large motorhomes 7,50 m and 8 m we passed our way."
111188,434260,5,barou,27/02/2019,"Perfect, the area is not yet tarred or sodded. beware there are 2 lampposts placed staggered around the service area, it can be annoying for long lengths."
111188,427709,4,inyaki0404,09/02/2019,Quiet and well located area. Ideal for a couple of days
111195,2455568,1,eleaundnoah,21/10/2022,"it doesn't look like it does in the pictures... everything is completely dried up. the road that leads to the parking lot shakes everything in the van... it's not worth coming here... too bad. 15 minutes further, however, there is an incredibly beautiful place with a view of the water and very, very quiet. So it was worth going out here after all :)"
111195,2395724,4,cedricholy,23/09/2022,"hi, I had a very nice stay here. very quite. although I chose a spot a bit further on the right hand side road. some sheep and barking dogs at a distance. this arm of the lake has dried out. at this moment they are carrying out some work and there is big holes everywhere. could be what it seems planting trees. watch out , don't drive into one ,-)"
111195,1127686,5,nomadstanley1971,03/01/2021,It's permissible to drive around the lake on this track. There are several places where the road is wide enough to park a van without causing an obstruction. I had a very peaceful night.
111195,473500,1,SuperPoste,02/05/2019,"There is only a dried-up river bed by now. No lake. 
Not really worth going."
111195,425638,4,angelique11,30/01/2019,Quiet place. Shepherd and sheep. Nice view with the mountains and hike possible. No facilities.
111200,2080436,2,BOGOVAN,16/07/2022,View of the lagoon very nice but there is not a shadow or much to see.
111200,1737583,4,naish666,20/01/2022,"We spent half a day. A site with beautiful views, listening to the road a little. Starting point for trails for sports."
111200,782545,5,Familie-M.,18/02/2020,Great little parking lot to enjoy nature for a few hours. Ideal starting point to watch the birds in the nearby observation cabin or to start a tour around the lake on the nearby path. No further services. Please respect nature and behave that way.
111205,2948467,5,ukulyly,11/07/2023,"Very good and quiet spot, beautiful view on the sunset in the morning. On the side of the road but I did not see or hear any car around."
111205,1322771,5,katymcinnes,14/07/2021,"Top spot and view, very quiet"
111218,748851,3,KnalLuna,01/12/2019,The only flat place is very close to the church ; the toilet was close in November and the water was not very clear. Ok for one quick night stop
111220,2646240,5,angeljo,07/04/2023,"Viewpoint with incredible views of the Jerte valley. Dirt esplanade, generates dust. Benches where you can sit. There is a refuge next door in very good condition with toilets (I don't know if they are operational) The road to get there is steep and with sharp curves. Not recommended for large vehicles. At the end there is a stretch of dirt in good condition. Google Maps does not take you to the exact location. Waze yes."
111220,2641602,4,esepepe,05/04/2023,"The site is spectacular, I see it difficult to reach with large ACs. with camper, no problem. Of course, it is an area that if the wind blows can be uncomfortable. The views and tranquility, however, are worth it."
111220,2550422,5,IndigenteJones,13/01/2023,I spent two nights here and didn't see a soul. Spectacular views and good excursions around
111220,2255190,5,CalieAdam,17/08/2022,"Crazy view, magnificent refuge, no water at that time. Super quiet spot but you have to deserve it! The road is not signposted and Google Map is not very useful. Where it takes you continue straight to a fountain, bench and trash can, it's that way."
111220,2255164,5,AlejandroMarx,17/08/2022,an incredible place and peace... the path is a bit confusing but it's well worth it!
111220,1966847,1,AdolTS,11/06/2022,Beware of going up with large vehicles that you can be unable to turn around and have a hard time. Concrete path and very narrow.
111220,1471815,4,AliiD,17/08/2021,"Spectacular place to see stars and be calm, the road is difficult, many curves, sometimes a lane that only allows 1 van, and at first steep climbs. It is better to ask the townspeople, after some hills, follow the paved road to a fountain, turn left towards the dirt road to reach the final stretch. I went with my van and I would not advise"
111220,1344535,5,Allaquevoy,20/07/2021,Very quiet place to spend the night. The temperature is great at this time of year. Ideal for FC. The beginning of the road has some slopes and there are a couple of tricky curves but it goes up and down well.
111220,1341193,5,PatriciaIncio,19/07/2021,Spectacular sunrise! Awesome setting. There was a lot of rubbish from previous visitors. Let's take care of the spaces. ;)
111220,1225972,4,hwneumann,30/05/2021,"A place with a beautiful view of the mountains and the towns down in the valley. Quiet during the day, but there is already excursion traffic in the evening, especially on weekends. Cross motorcycles also come and practice off-road. But you can sleep perfectly and in peace. Warning: Googlemaps does not know the streets there and leads you completely wrong. iPhone Maps works fine."
111220,1223602,5,Flagoneteros,29/05/2021,"I value based on the other qualifications because after climbing a paved road with difficult curves for AC we were unable to arrive at night. There was no one to ask. From Barco de Ávila, maps are not good for you either. It makes you finish the 400m tour on foot. If the maps give you that option, beware that it does not take you. We will try during the day"
111220,1115827,5,Marksalva83,17/11/2020,"Great, ideal place to rest and spend the night. Be careful with the season since the roads, despite being practically asphalted until the end, are very steep and with the wet ground the van has given me more than a scare due to the water and the leaves on the ground. Spectacular night"
111220,954746,5,maxzvanlife,12/08/2020,Amazing views when you get there! DO NOT FOLLOW GOOGLE MAPS THOUGH THE TOWN! Keep going for a bit then take a right! Very quiet with a few locals
111220,744656,4,3ki,18/11/2019,"A great txokazo to see stars, when the asphalt road ends there is a fountain to fill bottles and from the viewpoint the views are spectacular. If you are coming from Plasencia, the directions to arrive with Google maps do not lead correctly to the place, beware! Always follow the paved road until it ends almost at the top."
111220,437947,4,navarroivann,09/03/2019,"Of very difficult access for AC, we raised two AC of 7 meters by very steep slopes with concrete asphalting and hairpin curves, low branches in some places, not suitable for novices or people with fear of complicated places. Without a doubt, the views and the place deserve the effort. Pernota traquilisima."

111221,474035,3,EdenHappie,02/05/2019,"Well located for visiting the city. About 20 minutes walk, good for small size because reserved for cars, I think"
111224,2849054,5,Nanaka,13/06/2023,"It exceeded our expectations. Toilets, water, picnic tables, bbq and a large play area for children. There is also plenty of shade and a flat, accusing path to walk on. We spent the night together with another motorhome. Very calm. Highly recommended to go with children."
111224,2695312,3,koakaracola,25/04/2023,"Tuesday 10:30 in the morning and all services closed, only access to water and picnic tables. Little coverage. Very quiet and clean."
111224,2590460,5,kikebrachoa,25/02/2023,"Very good area to rest. We didn't fall asleep there, so we don't know. There is a picnic area, barbecue, free toilets and showers and free water. The only bad thing is that the showers are cold water. For the rest, an excellent place in the middle of nature."
111224,2569636,4,silviamarinero,05/02/2023,"Very large recreational area, well leveled, with clean bathrooms, even showers (they were open). On these dates (February) we were alone. I take off a star because a pounding music was heard in the distance that I did not discover where it came from. Very close to the town of Sax where you can dine."
111224,2546979,4,belen87,08/01/2023,"Ample space, good services, the toilets and grills are closed at night but they open around 10 am, quiet to sleep. You can go with dogs calmly, at lunchtime it is more difficult to find a place, but after 4 no problem"
111224,2539645,4,JamieGross,03/01/2023,Spent one night here just before Christmas. Very quiet. Good to park. Toilets are locked in winter. Perfect to start a quiet day with children.
111224,2039643,4,BDDJFG,05/07/2022,We used it as an intermediate stop for the children to stretch their legs and have dinner. Very well. Bathrooms closed and fountains turned off in July.
111224,1802198,5,mara66,31/03/2022,Excellent place! Super quiet night. Very spacious and well appointed. We were able to fill up with water (in the can because the tap is too far to put a hose). Only one car passed around 8 p.m. but the weather was very bad. Surely livelier in season.
111224,1773373,5,jessouille,04/03/2022,"Ideal for families, our 6-year-old son took full advantage of the playground. the year the toilets are not open on weekdays. There is a drinking water point, be careful with the GPS which can make you go through unpaved roads while access is easy."

111224,1682053,5,lph,08/11/2021,Great spot. Lots of room for larger campers in the overflow car park. Seems that in winter the toilets are open daytime at the weekend and shut during the week.
111224,1675461,5,EllieC,02/11/2021,"Great place! Only ones here, very peaceful and felt safe even though remote. Toilets were open until dark and didn’t reopen in the morning (we left at 9am though). There are bins and a water tap here, and lots of flat places to park."
111224,1334344,5,laabu2,17/07/2021,"Great area to disconnect. We spent the day on Saturday with our Camper, why we did not know that we could spend the night, but the next getaway ... we stayed"
111224,1277840,3,LauraSA,26/06/2021,"It is a very good place to spend the night, clean bathrooms, showers, laundry rooms, tables, a free camping area ... Of course, if you want to sleep on the weekend, bring earplugs. Until 4 in the morning music and bottle of a group of young people. We went on Friday and they told us that the rest of the days they had been able to rest well! A shame, because the site is perfect!"
111224,1172221,5,Enilau,11/04/2021,"Great to spend the night, very quiet place. The bathrooms, sinks and barbecues were operational from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., at least the weekend we were"

111224,1036665,3,Spatzel,09/09/2020,"Very lively, I was here in the weekend, and there were a lot of people! The parking spots were all full. I drove instead of right to the parking place a bit further down the asphalt road to the Pbus and spend there the night alone. All night people making noise tho. Great walks, very friendly people, great place to BBQ, just not very quiet."
111224,960398,5,LauV,13/08/2020,I had a very quiet night. Shaded area.

111224,928544,4,rvanvugt,04/08/2020,"Popular with big and loud Spanish families, especially Friday/Saturday. Even weekdays it never becomes really quiet, only between 00h00 and 07h00. But, I spend 4 nights, lovely walks, beautiful nature, waterfontains to cool down, BBQ and enough space. Lovely but lively area, in summer..."
111224,875654,5,cloud400d,17/07/2020,"We spent one night and everything was perfect. We arrived at 23:00 and left at 10:00. There was only one caravan. The site is very wide, there is shade and a lot of routes to do. Also tables and chairs to eat."
111224,752910,4,bertiebuggie,12/12/2019,"Only stopped here for a break but might make a good stopover. Big picnic area with lots of tables, BBQs, water points, toilets. Fairly narrow and bumpy access track."

111245,2558118,5,annaubdfloundbob,22/01/2023,Stood here for one night. You stand calmly and sheltered from the wind. There are beach showers and toilets. The Costa Calma beach is just beautiful.
111245,2526600,4,RuimanPerez,22/12/2022,I have been and felt unsafe. They told me that two Moors are breaking in in the afternoon and at night and are trying to steal boards and material from the caravans on the outside. I caught them and they ran out and got on a motorcycle. I left in case they came back in a larger group.
111245,2472467,5,bogdanhh,30/10/2022,"The location is quite good. The beach is close and you can enjoy a good time here. There’s no place to eat though, so be prepared. The showers and the toilets are clean. Show is outdoor, toilet, indoor :-))"

111245,2292078,4,estebanweisi,23/08/2022,"It is a parking with two heights. Very windy at least the day we were there. There were only a couple of places that were well guarded. Showers and bathroom next to the surf school that open in the morning. If you can approach Latija, all the better."
111245,2264741,4,deepems,18/08/2022,"It is a piece of land. It has two zones. A wide area where the cars of visitors and users of the surf school come and go and a small area where there are always caravans and vans. The roof can be opened as it is sheltered from the wind. strong in that area. At night there is silence. But once dawn breaks and the school opens, the music starts and so on. It has a bathroom and a shower"
111245,1949745,5,Javiersm,05/06/2022,Restroom service hours from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Good place sheltered from the wind to open roof.

111253,3104469,1,RUCLE,08/08/2023,"Cuevas de Almanzora does not want motorhomes to consume in its restaurants, supermarkets and gas stations. Total insecurity on the part of the urban police who discriminately fine motorhomes. Sultry. Mayor make you see it!!"
111253,1733848,1,Falvarez.tec,14/01/2022,"An unsuitable place to spend the night, especially in autumn, this is a boulevard that floods in times of storms and can drag down a motorhome."

111253,428825,4,walsch,13/02/2019,"Large, level, earthy place immediately before the northern entrance. No service, no prohibition signs, mobile good. At the end of the square is a good restaurant. The only drawback is that the small side street is audible in the morning. The place is one of the alternatives for those who do not want to be crammed like the sardine as in some other places nearby."
111256,767419,4,SerendipitousNomad,11/01/2020,Have stayed many times overnight without issue. Free wifi and cheap food at IKEA.

111256,656922,4,martina23,24/08/2019,"Nothing romantic about a a big parking lot in front of a supermarket but there are some plus points: shops, supermarket, toilet, baby room available from morning to late at night. A security guy keeps an eye on the parking spots around, but I think also keeps an eye on the campers. Can get really windy there and hot!"
111256,483301,1,Ancely,13/05/2019,"Parking to avoid. Noisy at all hours (group of young people with big engine). My wife was not reassured and did not close the night's eye. Only positive point: sanitary and wifi in the mall, opening hours, it goes without saying."

111262,1867453,1,DavidWood,03/05/2022,"Extremely gross and dirty, flies covering the walls of the showers. They mostly seemed to scatter once the heat had been running but was still pretty gross to have them flying around me as I showered. Also the distinct smell of someones defication flooded the shower room towards the end which made me question how sanitary it all was."
111262,1720430,4,ChloeGe,30/12/2021,The shower was hot and clean. For 3€ it was great!

Access road is a dirt road, but in a pretty good condition, I think even for larger camper vans. Beautiful hikes from the camping area. Do go around montaña negra for a sunset."
111314,3072436,3,ScotchAndSoda,04/08/2023,Not suitable for bigger vehicles.  Nice area but you need to ask for a permit and they only allow maximum 6 campers. Almost impossible to get a spot during weekends and school holidays.
111314,2076341,4,FurgoSurf,15/07/2022,"Beautiful place in the middle of a pine forest with water service and bathrooms. Permission must be requested through the council's website, specifically for the Arenas Negras Recreational Area. To spend the night you have to go to the caravan camping area, not to the parking lot of the Recreational area. Very close to hiking trails."
111314,1752419,3,Troubadix,10/02/2022,The actual camper place and the toilets were closed because of Corona when I was there today. The geo-coordinates mark the turnoff from the paved road. Then it's another 2 km on a forest path. Borderline for normal cars with normal ground clearance.

We decided to look for an alternative as we wouldn't be able to sleep with so much noise from the clubs. It's 2:30 in the morning and everything is calm.

If you have luck, you feel a bit of the breeze. :) Definitely not leveled, but that didn't bother us. The beach is great and has toilets and showers in less than 3 minutes on foot. Drinkable water in a small black spring just before the beach. We stayed 3 nights."

111327,2939510,5,madmaddi,08/07/2023,"The parking lot is free and less than 100m from the beach. The public toilets are nearby, but only open from 10am to 7:45pm. Unfortunately, it can get noisy at night. But perfect for one night."
111327,2925878,4,Nouvelviee,05/07/2023,free parking near the beach with shower but be careful a man with lots of tattoos walks in the parking lot and asks for money to monitor the campsite either say....
111327,2872757,4,holkyzbrd,20/06/2023,"we stayed on Monday night together with 15other vans. still plenty of room. Very quiete at night.
right in front of the beach. huge waves.red flag. kids playgrounds everywhere."
111327,2838120,3,spandey,10/06/2023,Stayed overnight in our campervan. There were about 12 motorhome parked there so we parked there too. Spent a night but it was noisy until midnight and early in the morning. The best things about that is the location that’s all.
111327,2729001,2,NatalieLindner,06/05/2023,Right on the beach. Parking lot is very hilly and dirty. Were asked that we should pay a parking fee. We didn't feel comfortable and moved on.
111327,2721521,4,sprdaniel,04/05/2023,Good place for sleep and start bike trip in Valencia...
111327,2665834,4,nycollipollheim,12/04/2023,"good place to spend the night, quiet, little noise and safe as there are several motorhomes there. Only the paving is bad because there are many holes and to enter you have to be careful because there is a step that can scrape the bottom of the van."
111327,2664232,4,BartNomade,12/04/2023,"Earth floor, with some irregularities that make level parking difficult. But very close to the promenade of Patacona beach, with several bars and restaurants. The presence of several motorhomes offers a certain degree of security. We spent a great night there."
111327,2656117,4,Jeselyn,09/04/2023,Good place because there are more caravans and there is some security.
111327,2639746,4,Michelin1974,04/04/2023,We have spent two nights. Very quiet parking in front of the beach. The terrain is quite bumpy but it was clean. Bike lane along the beach that connects great with the oceanografic (20 min) and the center of Valencia in 25 min.
111327,2574945,2,CyranoFlea,11/02/2023,The city does not make much effort for motorhomes. The dirt ground is full of holes and dangerous to get out when it rains. 4 years ago we were allowed to spend the night in the large paved car parks next door. Quiet night all the same and the advantage is that there is bus line 19 one street behind to reach the center and the city of arts for 1.50€.
111327,2574228,1,manitour251,11/02/2023,"The place is very dirty, especially after rain. Lots of dog poo around the vehicles. The owners positioned pylons next to his mobile home, probably to keep other people parked at a distance."
111327,2561811,4,stowey,27/01/2023,"Had to drive round twice looking for entrance and car park has numerous large potholes and bumps. On the plus size you are right on the beach, 30 minute bus journey to València and it’s free."
111327,2559684,5,Sobulla,24/01/2023,I stayed 5 days ... shower taken in the nearby gym at a cost of € 1.80 .... water available in the nearby fountain facing the sea ... by bicycle you can reach the center in 20 minutes ..... the cycle path was very pleasant ... from the camper you could use free wifi offered by the city of Valencia (only for Android ) ... not powerful but sufficient ....) ... Thanks Valencia
111327,2538946,3,albertoyjennifer,02/01/2023,"Wide, unpaved area. Very well located in front of the promenade. We parked to go eat in the area and without problems."

111327,2518833,4,YisusCar,10/12/2022,"I have spent one night and we have not had any problem, there was more AC AND a van in the parking lot. The parking lot is dirt and next to it you have a sports center where there are showers and toilets for €1.8"
111327,2486960,4,Glorily,07/11/2022,"We have spent 1 night and all very well and quiet, very close to the beach. right next door is the pavello malvarrosa de sports that for 1.80 you can take a great shower from Monday to Sunday. There is also a nearby Repsol gas station with a laundry service where you can have your laundry clean and dry for around 10e. I think it's a good place to spend a few days and see the city."
111327,2401630,1,FelixOlmos,25/09/2022,"This morning here in Malvarrosa the police began to instigate all the motorhomes to leave this vacant lot in front of the Malvarrosa sports center... I stayed, it is private land, it is not municipal. They can't force you. I met paumany I have been in this place for a long time and I have seen this up to four times a day in cars and motorhomes. I do not recommend it"
111327,2356594,1,paumeny,10/09/2022,"We came to spend one night. At one in the morning they did not break the driver's window glass and enter the motorhome. My children, who were still awake, saw the thief and started calling us for help. He ran away. Other people in the area have told us that this has become very common lately."
111327,2259946,2,saxytalk,18/08/2022,"Empty, rough underground site where people park and unfortunately leave a lot of garbage. To enter you have to drive on a zebra and footway. Toilets on the beach (but we didn't use them) and lots and lots of restaurants serving mainly seafood. Road is wide enough but people walking don't care much so you should drive carefully."
111327,2200669,2,cindy1827,08/08/2022,"the car park is practical because it is by the sea and the cycle path takes you to the city center in 20 minutes. on the other hand, very dirty parking lot and above all people are trying to open all the doors of the motorhomes. they tried to get into ours around 2am and we tried all over the parking lot. to avoid especially when it is hot and you leave open"
111327,2134331,2,Leiuys,28/07/2022,"THEFT! Great location on a Dirty parking area. we stayed for 3 nights, 2 of those nights had theft from vans due to he heat and a lot of vans sleeping with the doors open. 
He was caught and chased away at 4am but assume he will return."
111327,2110722,5,kathaxr,23/07/2022,"Nothing to complain about. Pleasant pitch for 1-2 nights. There were other campers there, so we felt comfortable. The beach, showers and a drinking water fountain are right next to it."
111327,2015120,4,Melissa.87,27/06/2022,"Dirt parking, not very flat, perfect for spending the night, near the beach, next to El Bobo restaurant, a recommended place to eat. We spent 2 nights and despite being the first time we slept in a Camper, we slept peacefully without much noise except first thing in the morning when some hats are put on in a nearby parking lot and they are noisy. I think if I go back to Valencia I will come back here"
111327,2002025,3,edugiansante,22/06/2022,Had some great few nights there although the sand and dust gets your car and everything super dirty every few minutes a car pass by. However in one night one of the kids minding the tourist cars tried to open my vans door. I shouted at him and he ran away. Next morning he was back alongside his other 20+ mates who mind cars - from that day I never spent a night there again
111327,2001192,3,babbnr,22/06/2022,"Well placed, quiet parking. On the other hand the ground is not flat and it is not really clean. Close to buses and the beach. We stayed here for 2 nights and 3 days and had no problems. 3 stars because of cleanliness."
111327,1971982,4,MariaIglesias12,12/06/2022,"It's free, lots of space, 10 steps from the beach, quite safe (there are always other caravans and cars nearby), quiet at night and the restaurants nearby are not expensive. Bus 32 leaves you in 10 minutes in the center. You can't ask for more for a city, highly recommended. We stayed 4 days at the beginning of June and without any problem."
111327,1903232,4,doriane3004,20/05/2022,"We didn't park on the ground because there was a big puddle of water, but we parked in the parking lot that runs along the palm trees. Stay several days no worries, shower on the beach, toilets, and police who come regularly. Just a little advice to buy a big sturdy lock for the bikes, we had a bike robbed in València in less than 2 hours .. because the city is quite far! ☺️"
111327,1893231,2,DavidWitt,16/05/2022,"Wren here in early May. Because it was well attended and there were a lot of police on the way, we explored Valencia by bike from here. Good bike path network!!! A lot of noise at night due to cars/motorcycles rushing by again and again. Only suitable for overnight stays if you don't have any problems with it. good for sunbathing and swimming during the day. Restaurants are delicious, even if they all offer the same thing."

111327,1803717,5,Jannis36,02/04/2022,"We were there in early April. Around us there were sometimes even very large mobile homes across the parking lots. The police are on the road a lot, you feel very safe and you can be on the beach in a few seconds. We stayed one night but you can stay longer."
111327,1800987,4,flavie01,30/03/2022,We spent the night in the concrete car park which is right next to it (out of season there are not many people). Pleasant bike ride along the sea and in town

111327,1726005,5,Luxezwerver,04/01/2022,"We are now here for four nights and on average there are at least twenty campers around us. So very safe. Valencia is a beautiful city with safe cycle paths. We are lucky with the weather, sun every day and wonderful bathing water. You can take an excellent shower on the beach. Supermarket around the corner, catering literally next door."
111327,1715379,5,RatayTeam,25/12/2021,"Great place for a few nights of free camping if you don't need services.  We met several terrific people, and there's easy access to the city center. Felt very safe and would come back again. There's a nearby gym if you want to have a shower, and free water fountains along the beach path"
111327,1710025,1,Wooolfy,14/12/2021,"You can stand up to visit Valencia. But when we came back the mobile home had broken into. We hadn't left money, papers etc etc in the car, thank God! So NOT RECOMMENDED"
111327,1708614,4,JPeterH,12/12/2021,Place is conveniently located directly on the beach. With bus 32 in 30 minutes in the center. 4 km by bike to the Expo site or change trains. A parking lot with potholes is free and safe because there are many 10-20 parking spaces here. Slept great. Police don't cause problems. No service. You can get water with a watering can. Garbage disposal is also possible.

111327,1378335,3,Iber,29/07/2021,"The place is good to spend a few days at the beach and visit the city. There is a bus line that takes you to the North Station, a must-see, and therefore to the center. It is dirt with many potholes, but if you wait until the end of the day you will get a better place. We spent a day and a half very comfortable and quiet at night. There was a curfew."

When I arrived lots of wet wipes, cans and rubbish so I cleared all rubbish, why don't more people clear after them to keep area nice.  A young couple let their dogs foul on the grass, I offered them a bag but they only spoke Spanish and did not want to clear up their dogs mess."

Close to free toilets, beach is nice. We do have a small van with no valuables, which makes us less of a target.

We ate delicious on the beach and went to sleep because the criticism is actually good. At about 5:00 we were taught something better. Our e-bike was stolen despite security (security lock 9 of 12) with a lot of effort."

111343,2564429,5,Thigger,30/01/2023,"Beautiful place, but is now regularly cleared by the police"
111343,2516417,4,elrocio,08/12/2022,Not easy to do better! Feet in the water Too bad it lacks a bit of sun!!
111343,2513744,5,frank1974,05/12/2022,all good in December. plenty of motorhomes there. very convenient to the center.
111343,1736416,1,Jean36240,18/01/2022,Ideal for a lunch break beware the Guardia distributes the fines so do not stay the night
111343,1161964,4,udoschmid,31/03/2021,"Great place. We were there at the end of March. Almost alone. A bit away from the street, so very quiet. No electricity, no water, but a great view over the sea from the top."
111343,1004362,1,sarah07092014,26/08/2020,The whole area is closed to motorhomes except the campsite. I do not recommend this city.
111343,751570,1,Mully,08/12/2019,"There is a sign as you go in, in several languages which says no campervans and that you could be fined  €3000. Funny there is a campsite up the road i think councillors are listening to the campsite owners. What a shame, if this is becoming the norm in spain and the spanish dont want us Morocco here we come."
111343,436641,1,pulgona,05/03/2019,"Two years ago here you could camp freely, it was great, but because of the campsite that is a little further on, they have forbidden it, I think under a considerable fine. it is a pity that the authorities give in to these pressures, there are other shops, restaurants ... that lose more."
111353,2615319,4,kristof_g,19/03/2023,"it's a small parking just outside the village, no services but more then good enough to visit the village and head out for a hike or biking. steep slope to enter but we managed well with our 7.5m Hymer."
111353,1117069,2,drlbradley,22/11/2020,Couldn’t park up here which was a shame because the view is beautiful. Really steep slope that our 7.5 meter wouldn’t make without grounding. Also many barking dogs!
111355,3289683,4,CamposManuel,12/09/2023,"We arrived at 7:00 p.m. and there was room, we had to turn around and enter another place. €13 a night, €3.5 for electricity. Good location right on the beach."
111355,3288557,1,moniquemonique,12/09/2023,"To avoid. Very unpleasant treatment by the manager. They give preference to regular customers. If you go in a large vehicle, they give you a not very pleasant plot that is difficult to access and secluded so that you do not disturb them. €12 and you pay all services separately. We left, after waiting for 20 minutes to be told where we could park. There are incredible places in the area and free."
111355,3279716,4,MartaMMH,10/09/2023,"The area is wonderful, the beach is rocky but with crystal clear water, perfect for snorkeling. Dogs are welcome, there is no charge for them. The staff that runs it is not the joy of the garden but they keep the area clean and it works well."
111355,3273077,5,josianesouchon,08/09/2023,we were very well received. 13 euros without electricity. washing machine 3.50 euros. superb pitches with sea view. Small beach and large ones further. tranquility. a magical place.
111355,3250433,5,IsabelCaEs,02/09/2023,"Located on the front line, on a natural beach. Sergio takes great care of you, attentive and helpful. Beach bar on the same beach. Ideal to spend a couple of days. Nearby town, you arrive by bike."
111355,3208355,2,FamilyCaracola,24/08/2023,"Arid place next to a rocky beach that can only be enjoyed if there are no waves. The light is not good. The owner, pushy and arrogant, said that the problem was ours. The beach bar appears to be good but it is not, the portions are small and the food is not of good quality. The desserts are not homemade. The price is excessive. €5 for a €1 supermarket coulant is stealing and cheating."
111355,3193897,5,rafaancls,21/08/2023,Great place next to the sea
111355,3180212,5,albertocarlassare,19/08/2023,"Magnetic place, in front of a spectacular beach and a beach bar with sessions and live music in the afternoons. The area is well maintained and clean. The plot is cheap, then electricity, shower, water recharge is paid but that's fine. 3 sinks and 2 bathrooms included in the price. Highly recommended! With or without children!"
111355,3136788,1,anfravi,13/08/2023,"without a shadow, unfriendly owner, you pay for shower and water. I will not come back"
111355,3102215,1,Delthib,08/08/2023,Beautiful beach at the motorhome. No shade. Paying showers and basic toilets. No warm welcome and a bit misogynistic.
111355,3099200,5,Aurelie8779,08/08/2023,Very nice place for a stopover we stayed one night there is a restaurant bar on the beach we could not eat there because closed on Mondays. Price for one day 13€ 3.5€ electricity for spacious showers is 1€ for 3min. Beach not great because a lot of rocks but you can swim there be careful left naturist beach! small town about 2/3 km.
111355,3085643,3,therry2020,06/08/2023,"Good place for a weekend with children, rocky beach but you can enjoy a lot."

111355,3000655,2,Naninounou63,22/07/2023,"supposedly great location lol avoid number 36 which is towards the mosquito-proof toilets. we didn't sleep all night, a horror, not to mention the fact that we can't go out until the owner is awake because he's the one who has the remote control for the gate the only positive point is direct access to the sea because 1 euro 3 minutes of showers is called theft"
111355,2997989,4,isabel1947campe,21/07/2023,Basic services for motorhomes and close to the beach. Very good deal.
111355,2965572,5,Silviadakar,15/07/2023,"The staff is very friendly, both Sergio and his father took great care of us and helped us with everything we needed. We spent a night on the beach with spectacular views listening to the sea for €13, it's worth coming. The shower for €1 every 3 minutes. Free water emptying, replace water for €2. The beach bar has live music until 12, then very quiet and pleasant."
111355,2838892,5,mxtintin,10/06/2023,"Beautiful place, we were facing the sea and the mountains. The sea is at the end of the land in a protected natural area. On the other hand, there are a lot of pieces of plastic in the sea, which may be due to the many cultivated fields in the area. The showers are hot but only last 3 minutes for 1 euro, it's a shame that you can't stop the countdown during soaping."
111355,2835851,4,ikerynago,09/06/2023,"Sergio is a charm. We spent one night in a beachfront pitch, a real luxury. Shower service (€1 3min), freshly baked bread in the morning €1 delicious. It's a pity that the beach bar they have was closed when we went because they told us they have coals and it's very good."
111355,2791582,5,jackie80,27/05/2023,"Beautiful place with spacious plots and beautiful planting around it. Beach with rocks right in front of the campsite where you are with 20/30 steps. A little further a sandy beach for naturists (also allowed with swimwear) The beach bar has excellent good food (recommended). The negative reactions are ?? for this price. We have been kindly received and the road is normal, so also those negative reactions are ??"
111355,2791348,3,jdugmore,27/05/2023,"Nice relaxing site with Sergio being very friendly. Facilities are basic. Disappointed that having filled our recently cleaned water tank, with what was supposed to be drinking,   discovered that the water was full of dust resulting in having to drain and clean tank again and waste all the water having paid extra for it."
111355,2778334,5,felix1412,23/05/2023,"What a find this was, absolute little gem, welcomed by Sergio who showed us round and explained where to find everything, clean and well maintained, on the beach where if you are lucky you can watch turtles, unfortunately the beach bar/restaurant was closed due to some bad weather forecast, but this is a place to stay again if in the area, sergio speaks excellent English and a great guy"
111355,2759675,5,YasminK,18/05/2023,"We had a great stay. Arrived at 7:30 p.m., called the number on the bell and, after a short consultation, were able to drive in and check in the next morning. price is great. Gladly again."
111355,2738973,5,Mairah,10/05/2023,"Hard to beat the price, the place is clean and the beach is amazing. adjacent to the square an excellent bar with great food. absolute pearl here."

111355,2713065,5,JavierAguilar,01/05/2023,The truth is that it is a very beautiful place. Very well adapted. Attached to the beach. There are several very comfortable winged coves. Domingo the owner is a spectacular person and treats you great. In fact in summer we will repeat. I recommend 100%
111355,2713064,5,Magicbus71,01/05/2023,fantastic area. Very well cared for and with all the services. On the beach. Very calm. The owners are charming and very helpful.
111355,2697122,1,RamonMateos,25/04/2023,"I always try to stop at the motorhome area, I wanted to spend a few days with my friend who lives in Aguilas, I decided to stop for a few days in this area and the area is unique, the area is far away and almost lost in the middle of a field. I arrive after 385 km at 6:45 p.m. and Mr. tells me on the phone, come back tomorrow, you must respect my rest schedule. No other option. What a shame and lack of ethics"
111355,2657121,5,bryancrossland,10/04/2023,Brilliant little hideaway campsite  .  2 minutes to the beach with a bar and restaurant  . Site owner nice and very friendly  pitch fees are really cheap and hook up .great little place to stay for a few nights

111355,2598433,5,ThatThereMotorhome,04/03/2023,"I try not to use campsites much but we found this one a really nice and laid back site, Easy access to the beach for sea kayaking also mountain biking in the area. Campsite owner is friendly we will return."
111355,2595109,5,MikeTyke,01/03/2023,Super site with a cool laid back feel nothing regimented and helpful owners. water costs 2 euro and with so many wild camping in this region I can see why they protect this little safe haven.
111355,2593325,5,Bummelsachse,27/02/2023,The parking space is totally beautiful despite incomprehensible descriptions. Domingo is a nice host and helps where he can. There is access to the beach and a bar in the summer. We would love to come back. There are shopping possibilities in Calabardina or in Aguilas.
111355,2592699,1,calif38,27/02/2023,"for those who only want to drain gray and black water and fill up with water, it's impossible even by paying"
111355,2588463,1,Frankenexpress1,23/02/2023,Most terrible place in all of Spain. You are locked up at night and you can only exit when the boss comes. No shops or restaurants nearby. Dirty Beach. Toilet and shower terrible. Never again !!
111355,2584101,5,Pappous,20/02/2023,"Super friendly welcome, large pitches, with the beach on one side and lettuce fields on the other. 2.5 km from Calabardina and 10 km from Aguilas. Nice for walking and cycling. Delicious freshly baked bread and hot showers every day. We have never stayed in one place for so long so will definitely return when we are in the area again."
111355,2579404,2,ansjejo,16/02/2023,there was no room but is also not recommended between the greenhouses and no shop nearby
111355,2566417,1,marfil28,02/02/2023,"Home odious the worst in Spain perhaps! the person at the reception who insults you, the site which seems poorly maintained and dirty. To be avoided absolutely if you are looking for calm and serenity. the owner should become a nightclub bouncer even if he seems puny."
111355,2565558,1,Aurion74,01/02/2023,"The place is lost surrounded by cultures certainly treated. hello the hassle to get there, huge holes, denounced and muddy road because submersible in places, everything to break the CC and the place is not idyllic for this effort."
111355,2565215,5,hasenteufel,31/01/2023,Great place. felt comfortable HH.
111355,2561192,5,3aufReisen,26/01/2023,Comparatively spacious plots. Lovingly landscaped and designed. The big hit: location right on the beach. The beach bar was closed in January and you could use the areas. Father and son take great care of the needs of the guests.
111355,2551966,5,Slowenc,15/01/2023,Perfect. Owner is special in the good way. We will return. Hi amigos
111355,2547533,1,emmamobil,09/01/2023,"Once and never again. Beautiful bay, uncivilized campers. Everyone does what they want, aggregate fully on, music for everyone, free-roaming, aggressive dogs and their owners, campfires as big as possible, lifting concerts. People who always live there and therefore exercise house rules."

111355,2476359,1,JordiMolinaAC,01/11/2022,"We have been to the bridge of all saints in this area and we saw this place. We approached to ask and a man came out with very rudeness insulting us and left over everything. It seems that he had it full of foreigners living for months and he was not interested . It is seen that the scarcity of places for AC, gives rise to this aggressive behavior. We ran away. By the way, the beach bar closed"
111355,2452123,4,etapacampera,19/10/2022,"The location is magnificent in front of a wild and very beautiful rocky beach. The area very well maintained, landscaped and with large plots. Sergio and Domingo are very attentive"
111355,2435936,1,pticlod,10/10/2022,I am well received by the owner who explains to me that it is not possible to only do the services. you have to stay to benefit from it. to flee.
111355,2435205,4,irenegoco,10/10/2022,Very well maintained area with comfortable plots. €9 a night without electricity and €1 a shower 2'. We did a bike route to see all the beaches and cliffs. Quiet area if you want to rest from the noise.

111355,2365285,5,FurgoGreta2022,12/09/2022,"In our new camper stage, we were lucky to find this piece of place at one of the stops. We spent 2 nights and enjoyed a natural beach of sand and rock and crystal clear water, with a beach bar awarded by the Repsol Guide... For 12 euros, little more can you ask for. You have set the bar too high to find a better place. Sergio and Domingo elegant people."
111355,2351214,5,PatFan56,08/09/2022,"superb clean and well-kept place near quiet naturist beach, bar-restaurant by the sea, village near 10 minutes by bike package possible for the month"
111355,2341872,5,lebrivara,05/09/2022,"Very good area away from urban centers if you are looking for tranquility, family business, super attentive son at all times, very clean individual showers. The rocky beach with crystal clear water, a beach bar with a good gastronomic menu. A few meters from the nudist beach. We will return without a doubt (we spent two nights)."
111355,2327679,1,JoseNunez,01/09/2022,"the owner was quite special with black humor because it was already very late and I went with my children if I hadn't turned around, the son, on the other hand, was more grateful, the beach was all full of rocks, at 6 in the morning I know he put a truck to working next door over a strong smell of manure my wife and I did not rest at all, for this price had I known I would have gone elsewhere"
111355,2313381,5,juancuenca,28/08/2022,"a wild area with all services. next to the beach, rocky, very clean waters and good swimming. 5 minutes away, another sandy beach, nudist, very quiet.

111355,2307993,5,JulianSM,27/08/2022,"The area is great, beachfront for €12. Free emptying and filling are €3. There are super comfortable and clean showers for €1. Domingo treated us super well and was always willing to help us with everything. His partner is also very nice. There is a beach bar right on that beach, and walking 5 minutes along the shore you have a nudist beach with very few people. If I go back there I will repeat."
111355,2301876,2,loloberte,25/08/2022,Nice welcome on the spot but very characterful owner we left….very clean very quiet
111355,2294299,5,VirginiePe,24/08/2022,"Closed and secure place with the presence of a permanent manager who can open the gate wide for you in case of emergency, I think. Authentic owner as we like, who explains things well about this great quiet place, nature with lots of preserved beaches and if you travel by bike, 10 minutes away, you will have an easier choice between sand or rocks. Great for snorkeling!"
111355,2289291,1,mingu077,23/08/2022,"Unfriendly treatment of the owner. No one can be held against their will to avoid not being paid, there are other more modern and legal methods. for emergencies, he says to call and he will come... drinking water, you have to ask for it and pay for it, the available water is suitable for showering, crockery, clothes, but not for drinking (??). The access road is terrible, if it rains you stay there."
111355,2285329,5,feva33,22/08/2022,"Perfect place for a vacation, every morning you can see the sunrise from the beach, direct access. With booties and caution 2 nudist and textile beaches. Clean and well-kept facilities and a lot of tranquility. Flies and wasps? The price to pay for being in the middle of nowhere. You have the town at 10' by bike! Sunday? A charm! To me x at least he took care of me down to the smallest detail!"
111355,2280685,3,Aroaclim,21/08/2022,"The site is fine, but the owner is not friendly at all, in the morning there are many flies, and although the beach is close they are very large rocks and you cannot swim. However, the plots are large and the bathrooms are very clean, there is also a beach bar."

His son constantly drives his noisy moped and checks the square. No shade, but 1000 mosquitoes!"

You can eat very well in the beach bar, it's worth giving yourself a treat and going out for lunch/dinner.

Small hut by the beach (which, depending on the direction of the wind, gives off the smell of grilled sardines, which you can enjoy from your motorhome) Friendly and welcoming owner making efforts to communicate in your language, this is unfortunately not the case for his son. Rather artisanal service area"

111355,1946241,5,mapiefred,04/06/2022,"nothing to say ... attractive prices, very friendly receptionist, direct access to the beach ... nothing negative to say ..."
111355,1945320,5,pacoymarely,04/06/2022,"We are having a spectacular weekend. Starting with the tranquility of the aresa, night without noise, everything calm, direct access to the sea, impeccable treatment by Domingo and his family, attentive to the well-being and needs of all of us in the area, with a phenomenal beach bar but that does not interfere with rest. Fully recommended, spacious and level plots."
111355,1917872,5,hvwalwyk,26/05/2022,Super nice well-kept location and friendly reception. Nice eating and drinking place on the beach. Beautiful cycling route to Anguilas
111355,1892429,4,Javierliebana,15/05/2022,"Charming location, spacious plots, sea views to the front and plantations to the rear. On the beach itself, showers, bathroom and sink service. Everything very clean, very friendly staff. In Wikiloc interesting circular routes."
111355,1886292,5,DataDijk,13/05/2022,Great location. Don't be put off on the way there that might suggest otherwise. Right on the beach and beach bar right next to it where you can eat.
111355,1835559,5,axbe0,18/04/2022,"Good place, managed with care by the owner and his wife and son. The price-performance ratio is fully in order. For us it was a wonderful experience how the family takes care of its guests in all walks of life. We really enjoyed the time we were allowed to be here and look forward to seeing you again."
111355,1819332,5,icobo,13/04/2022,"We have spent two nights here, a super nice and quiet place. Very friendly staff, sleeping with the noise of the waves is priceless. We will certainly return."
111355,1812022,4,YakiCanelo,09/04/2022,"In April the price was 11 euros + 3 electricity. They should update the app. The place is great, quiet, you sleep in luxury…."
111355,1765099,5,CarmenRamirez,24/02/2022,"Friendly place like the boss's son. We spent a very pleasant night with the seaside right next door. The facilities are a bit rustic and in need of a refresh but hey, I'll be back.... Beautiful Spanish coastline."
111355,1752483,1,Belalein,10/02/2022,"I really can't explain where all these positive reviews come from... sometimes I think some of the reviews here are fake. The showers and toilets are a disaster but what really knocks the cake is the washing up of the dishes. So much dirt and grime and rusted shelf, yuck. The beach isn't really a beach either"
111355,1741158,4,WolfgangSchmidt,25/01/2022,I only saw the place from the outside. Looks good but is completely full. Also the next few days.
111355,1736794,4,JuergenD,19/01/2022,"Nice place, completely full. Without a reservation, we were at least able to park in the parking lot next door. Current very unstable. WiFi good. Shower 1€ for 3 short minutes. Better to bunker water at the Anibal gas station. Disposal is ok. Sympathetic owner."
111355,1728207,5,Wiese21,06/01/2022,"I think it's great that someone finally wakes them up. It should be like this everywhere. Bravo, we'll be back in 3 weeks! Boosted!"
111355,1727863,5,Koenigin,06/01/2022,"Dear vaccination refusals, please note that you are a minority and are guests in this country. In any case, I think it's good that we can feel as safe in this beautiful place as it is possible in these times. In any case, the nice operator does not get his instructions from overly correct Germans, but from his mayor."
111355,1725970,5,Nomaden2019,04/01/2022,"Respect for so much backbone, hasn't been there yet, but I'll come next fall. Keep it up."
111355,1725369,5,Go_Vegan,04/01/2022,"A great and quiet place on the beach, the closest trade 2.5 km away. The decoration and the gardening are very careful and very beautiful. Very clean toilets and showers The area for washing dishes and washing clothes by hand is very neglected. The water is not drinkable, you have to bring cans to drink and cook. Large pitches to put tables and chairs. QR Covid passport required"
111355,1725312,1,Frankenexpress2,04/01/2022,"Since no vaccination card could be presented, we were told: then you have to go now. It's a shame, we've been on the pitch for weeks. The way you deal with your guests is not okay. Yes, it is correct that every campsite operator has a responsibility, the HOW is decisive here. No vaccination certificate: no entry and guests have to leave"
111355,1725143,5,kalmar50,03/01/2022,"A very nice place with fantastic management that at a good price give you all the service you can wish. i should have stayed one night but it became Three. Will be more in the future.
they even offerd free help to those who needed a covid vaccination. including registrering at authorities and time booking. those who complain should maybe ""sweep their own stair"" before righting bad about others."
111355,1716724,5,Baisi,27/12/2021,"Privileged location direct access to the beach, large pitches, very clean bathrooms, sinks and showers. I do not understand the negative comments, they are € 8 / day, electricity, water and showers apart, but it has a sink for dishes and a laundry for clothes at no cost, logically better to pay for what you need to pay a higher fee and have it all included even if you don't need it."
111355,1715383,1,ThiloHeb,25/12/2021,"No thank you ! - after 18 days we had to leave the place because we could not present a vaccination certificate. We should go as soon as possible. Caution ! no ec card payment possible! Receipts were only given on request! 8 euros the space, 3 euros electricity. 1 euro shower for 3 minutes. Water also costs extra! and not available on site. No recommendation !!"
111355,1715352,1,AxelKaatsch,25/12/2021,"Everything seemed great, but after 27 days we had to leave the place immediately in the morning after we had not accepted a vaccination offer, although everyone was there without a mask or distance. Probably depending on the mood of the owner."
111355,1712534,1,ylang-ylang,19/12/2021,"A camping area because it is certainly attractive in terms of price, but that's it. Prison atmosphere. Only the owner decides on your exit, so if health emergency at night, we had to call him on his phone which would join the emergencies !!!! Once there, there was no more drinking water. We had to wait for delivery the next day during the day. Nature reserve, but dirty beaches."
111355,1710121,5,park4nightliisa,14/12/2021,"Wonderful place directly on the beach. Dog friendly, they can run free on the beach. there are toilets, showers, counters, washing machines and flushes. Boule. Bread truck coming. Make sure you have the fridge full and drink enough before you come here. Is probably the best place on this trip. Stay several days like most here. Gets easily full here so do not come too late. Popularly! The gates close at 18:30."
111355,1708980,5,Martinezfamily,12/12/2021,"Clean and quiet place. We almost slept by the sea, hearing the waves of the sea. Thanks to Domingo."
111355,1704323,3,the_only_van_,06/12/2021,"No potable water, we didn't stay"
111355,1703668,2,KatrinLinnemann,05/12/2021,No service possible for me when staying overnight
111355,1700310,3,jubinBernard,29/11/2021,Access by a path full of potholes over 5 km .... and complete! not recommended.
111355,1690302,4,javeasteve5,15/11/2021,"Spent 3 nights here having been lucky to get in, as was full.  The manager a jovial, knowledgeable and likeable guy was friendly and helpful, no idea why some say otherwise as over the three days we saw him interacting with others all of whom appeared to like him.  The site is safe and great if you want to stay in the area but be warned there is not a lot to do/see."
111355,1685600,2,jJeannin,11/11/2021,Not having places does not exclude being smiling and kind.
111355,1684783,5,Sissi22,11/11/2021,"We stayed here for 3 nights, we love this place. Nice boss. Magic frame. Clean sanitary. Be careful, far enough from all shops, if not motorized, provide"
111355,1682589,4,TAMZEL,08/11/2021,"Nice place with all amenities. I didn't like the owner, he really is the 'boss' and he likes everyone to do what he says."
111355,1675660,5,05091959,03/11/2021,Very good reception 13 € all inclusive beach 50 m. clean sanitary. we will surely come back.
111355,1669605,2,SyFri,30/10/2021,"Parked in the back like in a parking lot, not very inviting. The nicer places are probably more for long-term parkers."
111355,1655866,5,Daniel_87,21/10/2021,"Very cheap, quiet and nice operator. Wonderful sunset by the sea, it is best to use bathing shoes for bathing. Only the flies annoyed us extremely, but we stood close to the entrance, protected from the wind, maybe it is a little better further towards the sea."
111355,1647027,5,andreasliebe,16/10/2021,"Very nicely located, lonely place in the middle of nature. Nice operator. Beach bar from 11.10. closed. Stand rocky. There is only one place where you can go into the water without shoes. Otherwise, however, the landscape is very beautiful. Maintained space, beautifully planted, sanitary facilities simple but ok. Disposal well organized. Bakers and laundry come to the square. We would love to come back."
111355,1644364,5,chenon,14/10/2021,"We have been there since yesterday, a heavenly place, very well wooded, large stabilized pitches, very nice owners, very clean toilets, beaches at the foot of the area, we sleep very well in peace. I absolutely do not understand the previous bad comments. We recommend 100% this little paradise for 8 € per night. Grumpy people who are never happy stay home."
111355,1642116,5,ChristineIrmscher,13/10/2021,Stayed here for 4 day's it was great again.  Father and Son are super friendly like always. It is the direkt neighbors you can't choose . We will be back .

111355,1616887,5,Uti3,29/09/2021,"Perfect! € 13 a night with electricity, and € 15 with water (100L) Very quiet area and virgin beaches"
111355,1615788,3,Festin,29/09/2021,"Privileged environment, which does not justify a certain neglect of the services in the area, in addition to being a bit expensive, € 3 electricity / day, € 2 filled with water. The goodwill of the owner, and his sympathy, supply almost everything. Good bike routes in the surroundings, and natural beaches."
111355,1610271,5,voyage11,26/09/2021,"We had spent a few days 2 years ago, the location still great. everything is there to enjoy the place. The boss very helpful, made a lot of new landscaping and planting. We will return."
111355,1599489,5,famboux,22/09/2021,"Site in the middle of nature, superb environment for cycle paths. Very nice home"
111355,1552819,4,Gemkb,06/09/2021,"Camping exclusively for motorhomes and vans. Pleasant, stabilized pitches, preferred those on the top because better ventilated and sea view. Water, drain, toilet, washbasin and sink free, shower € 1 for 3 minutes, washing machine € 3. access to the beach. the restaurant next door doesn't make any noise but is quite expensive. bike rides."
111355,1538898,5,filz1961,01/09/2021,Was here on April 21st. I liked that very much. Will stop again.
111355,1532657,4,waragi,30/08/2021,"Beautiful views, no restaurant on the beach at the moment as it's closed since yesterday. The owner has a humour that surpasses everything especially if one cannot speak any Spanish."
111355,1532327,2,Alzu,30/08/2021,"A very peculiar place. We arrived on Monday morning and the first surprise is that on Mondays the beach bar closes for rest (it seems strange that August closes one day) We also found it strange that the door is closed from 9:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., if you arrive earlier they will open you and if you arrive later then .... that was the explanation they gave us."
111355,1529183,4,Carles1234,29/08/2021,Good place to rest for a couple of days. The crystal clear beach and a beach bar that gives the place a bonus. A van passes to bring the bread. The town about two km
111355,1528376,4,Rogerdeflor,29/08/2021,"A good place to have tranquility, in addition the beach of the previous cove is naturist. You do not see any population in the surroundings, nor do roads pass ... a paradise. Call ahead to book, or give WhatsApp ... at least in August"
111355,1516943,5,DejanJanicijevic,26/08/2021,"A spectacular place. In the middle of nature, with a beach bar, live music, beach etc ... Only payment in cash. Highly, highly recommended ... Total relaxation .."
111355,1511232,4,rocioalcaide80,25/08/2021,"We loved it, clean bathrooms, super cool, the only downside is that the floor stains a lot, otherwise than 10 !!!!"
111355,1510848,5,C.Soriano,25/08/2021,"Ideal place on the beach, with clean bathrooms and a cheap beach bar and a menu with vegan options. 10 euros a night for a van and two adults."
111355,1494472,5,AventuraRutera,21/08/2021,"We spent three nights from August 16 to 19 in AC, three adults, two children and a dog were very comfortable. one step away from the beach (high boots recommended) and the bathrooms / showers always clean. A great treat and a little paradise, we will repeat. My recommendation is to go with a full pantry so you don't have to move."
111355,1485223,4,xinxan,20/08/2021,"Great place to spend a few days on the beach, with a beach bar next to it, excellent treatment, I do not give it 5 stars because there is nothing next to it to buy, although for the treatment place and services it deserves it, we will return, if we pass there"
111355,1468471,1,Coutinho,16/08/2021,But the man at the door sais there is no place for me!!! And hi didn’t allowed to do the maintenance ? even if I want to pay for it! So we go to the park nearby and stay for a lovely night… so thank him? it was for free and beautiful! So don’t go there!
111355,1429028,4,keniatxan,09/08/2021,"Great area. The attention of Domingo and Sergio spectacular, they help you in everything they can. The beach has a very cool txiringuito. Exit to wild and little crowded beaches."
111355,1426334,4,guiry,08/08/2021,"Great place for a couple of days, right next to the beach, very good beach bar and the staff too, services and showers ok, the owners are really nice, totally good area"

111355,1401107,4,raquelcri,03/08/2021,"Very nice and quiet environment. With a beach bar on the beach. It is not a dog beach, but no problem. How the only thing is the flies and the unkindness of the staff that runs it."
111355,1395481,5,QuiqueArriaza,02/08/2021,"A magnificent place to disconnect and absorb an ideal climate. Literally attached to the beach. The pitches are spacious and in time the trees will provide plenty of shade. Clean and spacious bathrooms and toilets. Chiringuito with a very good variety on the menu and at a price according to the location neither expensive nor cheap. We have a dog and if you have two fingers in front you will not have problems, it is not a dog beach."
111355,1366124,1,campingcarlaureetclaude,26/07/2021,"Nice area with direct access to the beach, however the prices are not up to date because the night is 10 euros to this is added if you wish 3 euros of electricity but some voltage drops so the fridge automatically switches to gas. Drinking water 2 euros for 100 liters. The boss has a moody and disrespectful behavior and insults easily"

111355,1358170,4,Isaclau,24/07/2021,"Pros: remote place that is not overcrowded, good price, all services, on the beach, good service, spacious pitches, beach bar with good food. Against: many flies during the day, overwhelming, only one sink and no light so the dinner pots have to be left for the next day."
111355,1353787,5,LUROMAX,23/07/2021,"An incredible site !! beach, chiringuito and Ac all in one, in a most peculiar place. As for the management of the AC area at all times they have been aware of our needs and very attentive at all times. We have to go back !!!!!"
111355,1352903,5,riviera2016,22/07/2021,"We went for a couple of days and stayed two weeks. Domingo and Sergio pending everything, they treated us like family. Clean everything, pass the baker, very safe, almost private beach. We will repeat for sure. very highly recommended."
111355,1333396,5,GiottiAlmeria,17/07/2021,"Perfect, we were with a van, they reserved us the last place and they did us a great favor, we were very comfortable. All very clean and very good atmosphere, total tranquility. We have loved it, the isolation that some comment is part of its charm, of course. We will be back, thanks to Domingo and his son."
111355,1325408,5,lafurgoneja,15/07/2021,"100% recommendable. Spacious and comfortable pitches. Both Domingo and Sergio staff with exquisite treatment, make the stay super pleasant. The bathrooms are very clean and the atmosphere of the area is great. Direct access to the beach and walking 5min you arrive at the Charco cove (naturist / dogs allowed). In the morning the baker passes by. We will repeat. THANK YOU, we are very grateful☺️."
111355,1321924,5,unai1976,13/07/2021,"Practically perfect, tranquility, excellent services, unbeatable treatment, we will return"
111355,1315333,3,marcguille,11/07/2021,"Site away from everything but fine. Customer service depends on the perfect young man, the biggest rude and bad manners. The chiringuito somewhat expensive for the area. some plots very well and others not leveled. For those who like to be away from everything, perfect. For those who want civilization, a very good day. Nearest town Calabardina 3 km. You can go on a side track by walking and / or by bike"
111355,1313179,5,JrRamone,11/07/2021,"Area of 10, very attentive staff, tranquility and perfect location. There is nothing around except the beach bar that shares space with the area and is very good. The beach of rocks and sand. Spectacular views."
111355,1302608,3,DennyCrane,07/07/2021,"Very, very friendly and chilled out owner, space is still quite new but good, direct connection to the sea and the restaurant there. aaaaaaaaber these lousy damn aggressive, stressful crap flying are more than the nuts."
111355,1289171,4,Chantalurpheant,01/07/2021,"Very warm welcome from Sergio, thank you to him for his attention. I will not say the same for the dad. He must have his faces and not like dogs too much. On the other hand, a superb place with direct access to the beach and its chiringuito where you eat very well with a warm welcome. Cash payment only for the camper van area. No shade at all."

It is true that the beach is made of stone, but around there are numerous sandy coves and Calabardina (town) 30 minutes away on a pleasant walk. Good place to rest and disconnect. Domingo who owns it is very nice, helpful and talkative."
111355,1221099,4,jfescoriza,27/05/2021,"The very beautiful enclave, very well-kept area, very friendly and helpful person in charge. In beachfront. I do not give it 5 stars since the beach is made of stone and you need booties for the bathroom"

The area has the basics and Domingo, the manager, has a point of humor that as soon as you gain confidence, he will make you feel at home. Very good camper atmosphere, long-stay people. Refrain posh, in Aguilas you have hotels."

111355,994363,3,Kanari,23/08/2020,It's fine to spend the night a couple of nights ... good beach and I try ..... it's nothing to write home about ... but you don't have to be delicate .... It's not a clear resort .... recommended. .and cheap.
111355,948857,1,antoniomt,10/08/2020,"I sincerely believe that I have been in a different place than these reviews ... a place that is an area mixed with cars, flies, I never saw so much fly, the beach very close, but a regular beach and of course the covid measures They go through the flag, simply nobody wears a mask or manager or anyone, the only thing they have is that it is cheap, but with electricity and drinking water they are € 13"

111355,761595,5,launaygu,01/01/2020,Excellent place everything is at the top. The owners Domingo and his son Sergio cannot do enough for you. They alone are the masters of the place
111355,755742,4,bertiebuggie,22/12/2019,Excellent site. Good views from most pitches. Direct access to a good beach with a mix of sand and rock. Drinking water charged at €2 for 100 litres as it is brought in by truck as piped water is not drinkable. WiFi is free but a bit flaky and slow. Site owner very helpful. Nearest shop is in Calabardina 3kms away but it is a bit limited. We would come back.

The place, next to the beach, spectacular ... It is worth enjoying. As it improves, the bathrooms .... They are very neglected. If in doubt we will return."
111355,731331,5,launaygu,27/10/2019,I apologize to Chantal d and Diane 91 I was wrong it is actually BELLEUSE then Marie 65 and ILYES who wrote comments that the place does not deserve too easy to hide behind a nickname
111355,704036,5,launaygu,25/09/2019,I regret the comments of those who hide behind a nickname such as Chantal D. Diane 91 and other stay home instead of spending your time criticizing and do not be afraid to put your name. You make me ashamed to be French with your rude and insulting comments
111355,703194,5,launaygu,24/09/2019,Some comments abused especially by Mrs. Chantal d and Mrs. Diane 91
111355,701627,3,piretdaniel,23/09/2019,"Do not trust the comments !!!! The boss is a lunatic who places you today and points out that you are taking up too much space the next day. In addition, the price is at the head of the customer, yesterday 6 € today 7 € !!!!! I have been a customer for 4 years, I will never stay there again."
111355,678851,4,Bzh29,06/09/2019,"Do not trust some comments. We arrived yesterday very welcome the boss and his son. For 10 euros including electricity we had a great night. Moreover, if you arrive during the absence of the owners, ask Guy a super nice French who stays on the spot several months, he will guide you while waiting for the managers with his kindness."
111355,678111,5,Oochie,05/09/2019,Just been there. Been twice before with my dog. Owner will not allow motorhomes to stay now if you have a dog. Real shame

111355,583556,1,Marie65600,29/07/2019,"Area that could be nice, because very well located, if it was maintained, and legal. This is clearly not the case. The boss does not have the necessary accreditations. A large green gate at the entrance which also serves for the small restaurant down below. And a wooden sign indicates that the area is closed! And yet Señor Domingo, rent and sub rent his parcels illegally. No paper, no bills, cash payment required. Monsieur rents the parcels in the month to the Spaniards, who come only the Week end and relets to the others 7 euros a day the week. Only on Friday, you are invited to clear to make room for Spanish renters. And if you do some wild camping, friends, be very careful, sir goes in the little coves a little wild, Madame at his side is there to film. And the next day the police arrive to verbalize you. Here, there!"
111355,582879,3,diane91,29/07/2019,"Welcome the owner. Arrived on a Sunday morning: almost complete area that empties on Sunday evening: avoid the weekend. Nice beach 2 steps. Toilets and showers average, prefer those of the camper. It is best to arrive with the tank full of clear water and the empty toilet. Beach restaurant open for lunch and dinner."
111355,581804,1,belleuse,28/07/2019,I do not recommend very dirty place with lots of flies the boss very unpleasant and always on the lookout for the landing of the police because location illegal payment in cash without invoice

For sanitary. ..this is not luxury ... we use the toilet and shower of the camper ... at the asking price ... 'do not be too demanding ...... the place is superb ..here is a little bit of any trade ..

A nice little place right on the sea, with bar and restaurant by 22 o'clock still a large selection of grilled meat and fish got, cold beer and soft music. We recommend. We are positively surprised! No Tourigerammel :)"
111355,530899,1,alnileb,27/06/2019,"Arrived at 20h, there was no one at the entrance and no barrier or indications. I entered and settled and stalled as we often do and we will register then. I go to the toilet in some species of toilets. Leaving an individual calls me in Spanish. I do not understand. He speaks to me in French and explains to me that I did not have to settle down without having been accepted by the boss, and the PATRON, it is him. There are 7 campsites because on site, and he refuses me on the pretext that everything is reserved ?? I am surprised and he turns me and refuses that I drain by putting behind my vehicle !! Unbelievable. Never seen this in 20 years of traveling throughout Europe and Morocco. This guy may be nice but not with everyone and his susceptibility is anti-commercial. Home lamentable and unworthy. I strongly advise against I bivouacked on the beach that leads to the site, I saw no Ccar pass ...."
111355,522791,3,U11216,20/06/2019,"Kind of messy. No delimited boxes provided. Dusty. Very nicely situated on the beach with chiringuito. We have not used toilets, but they do not seem really clean."

111355,469311,4,2momsontheroad,27/04/2019,"Super nice place! Grandiose view and great beach with beach bar. Super dear operator, very helpful. When it's busy, you're pretty close. The sanitary facilities are not so great. Toilet is shared with guests from the beach bar. But if you have a toilet on board that is unimportant anyway. This place does not have such stuffy people as you often meet. So if you like it a little cooler, go there. Every now and then a ""green"" breeze blows from the beach bar."
111355,458129,5,Ulfender,18/04/2019,"Absolutely great parking space with electricity, water and sewage. Another feeling in the middle of hotels and tourist places. Highly recommended if you love it lonely. The operator and the staff are super nice and help where they can!"

Negatives are no drinkable water ( didn’t bother us as have lots on board) and no hot showers ( again we have our own on board) we will return"
111355,433847,4,tibertrix,26/02/2019,Excellent rest area near the cliff. Interesting and peaceful place.
111355,428358,4,nelsona,11/02/2019,Just arrived here and it’s beautiful. Right on the beach and with its own bar It’s a real find. Only downside no hot showers! but very reasonable site fees more than compensate. €7 plus €3 for electric. Stay a week and it’s €6 and 2!
111386,2494425,1,Traxxxx,13/11/2022,Today there were about 6 different vehicles. But I drove on because there is a sign saying that camping is forbidden.

It has a lot of wild animals near like little “Bambi” gazelles. It is not a bad place but a little alone here..."
111388,741152,2,Tornjak,10/11/2019,"Quiet, tarmac, generally level parking and accessible to all sizes. Out of season the Sanctuary represents a relative interest. Emergency parking or lunch. I did not spend the night here. Optimal satellite and 4G reception."
111393,2885355,5,Craigy24,23/06/2023,"Amazing! Shade, cold showers and toilets with toilet paper. Very quiet in all aspects. Absolutely beautiful sunset and a great base for walking / cycling. 
As stated the last section of road is pretty steep with a couple of hairpins and it's not really ideal for big vans."

111393,2421609,5,AntonioAlvarez,03/10/2022,"Shady parking lot, very crowded in the mornings and quiet in the middle of the afternoon/night. Bathrooms and drinking water and containers. Perfect for starting trekking routes, such as the famous snow cellars or the top of Montcabrer. Let's take care of these sites"
111393,1163191,2,Abriluchi,01/04/2021,"Perfect site. Bathrooms, water and tables. But a forester came to remind us that we couldn't sleep there, we had to go."
111393,1072421,3,gneomo,27/09/2020,We have already gone several times and the place is great but the last (10/26/2020) at 3:30 in the morning was a car and it was for a while with the doors open and music at full volume and around 4 o'clock many people passed by Screaming it seems they made a bottle on the picknic tables.
111393,900880,5,riftercoco,26/07/2020,"Very quiet place. We have spent a night and a day in the shade of the pine trees. At night not a sound. It has clean toilets (the showers were closed), water taps, picnic tables, and bins. Within 5 minutes there is a small waterfall to cool off."

'Ranger' (a guy with green cloth) told us, that we are not allowed to spend the night. But he actually didn't make the impression, that he really cares. Just told us, because he was there anyway."
111393,749832,5,Cathconnell,04/12/2019,"Wonderful overnight stop surrounded by woods but not so good for a big van. We are 7.5m and we struggled in the rain on the wet road surface. Great facilities, clean loos with paper but showers were locked. Too rainy for us to hike unfortunately"

111393,445783,4,jrrks,28/03/2019,Nice picnic area in pine shade. Toilets open 24h and water on taps little above them. Also garbage bins. Steep road on final 1km. Not very big parking lot and 2 MH would fit without blocking it. Good for treks on Sierra Mariola and overnight stay.
111394,2855232,5,Knet,14/06/2023,Perfect if you are autonomous. Very quiet in the morning at 1/2 nine. 4 fishermen did not bother you. The view alone was worth stopping for
111394,2729601,5,LorraineundManuel,07/05/2023,"Very nice place - you have to walk down to the lake. A flock of sheep comes by in the morning and evening. If you want to stand, like in the photos, you have to be early. 6 vehicles don't fit there."

The access is a little difficult if you have a very low car, since the step of the road is quite high, but with care you can access it well."
111394,2581441,5,Alix06,18/02/2023,"Very nice view and fairly quiet road. The location is excellent to go do the Caminito del Rey the next day. On the other hand, if there is wind the place is very exposed and in the van, we felt the gusts of wind all night long."

111394,2218294,4,paulaundsamiontour,11/08/2022,"Very nice parking space, probably not really allowed because there are some signs in the area. But we had no problems. We collected some rubbish, it's a pity that there is so much lying around. View of the lake is definitely worth it :)"

If you have a 4x4, there are even more possibilities if you continue further. It's next to the road but still calm and quiet. Beautiful landscape and walk around the reservoir. Herd of sheep passes by 2x a day! Tranquil spot where we spent 2 days."

111396,3130332,4,nellypulik,12/08/2023,"Very nice spot, really avoid going there in a motorhome, it is very tight and very complicated to turn around once at the end if you are in a motorhome / we were in a Vito and it was perfect. Incredible view"
111396,2413565,5,tourguideucantrust,30/09/2022,"Very nice place and giving two stars because you overlook a sign? Yes, oh dear police, unfortunately I didn't see that it was a 30 zone and drove 100, I can't help it. No very nice place, but unfortunately not overnight, that's the rules in the nature reserve. Better take your rubbish with you, otherwise this will never change."
111396,1754013,2,Fontain,12/02/2022,"Very nice, however, access is prohibited for campers. Didn't see the sign and less than 5 minutes later the GNR was there and I was allowed to pay 60 euros."

111396,1677409,1,KikiCiki,04/11/2021,"In the village at the entrance to the road that leads to this place there is a ban on access to campers. In Portugal now not only can you not stay overnight anywhere, but not even access to parking during the day .. really sad"
111396,1603340,4,MaribeliaEnMovimiento,23/09/2021,An extraordinary view and a cove to enjoy. For 4-5 campervan.
111396,1468308,2,dirisarri,16/08/2021,The site is spectacular but the police have arrived at 9 o'clock at night and have thrown us out of the 4 vans that we were
111396,1105242,5,dan2020,25/10/2020,The trail along the coastline is breathtaking.
111396,1068374,4,MarkusMarko,24/09/2020,"Wonderfull cliff setting to stay with the camper, only spoiled by traffic sign at the beginning of the road that forbids campervans.
Nevertheless we stayed for one night with 2 other campers and were lucky that the GNR didn't show up."
111396,1050381,5,janatimo,15/09/2020,Wonderful place. We would sleep there again in a heartbeat. There were 3 other vans / RVs with and there. It was very quiet. Great sunset over the sea :)
111396,1019309,5,maddyp,01/09/2020,The best place we stayed on the portugal coast! Beautiful sunset and private beach. A few local fisherman at night and in the morning. We stayed overnight without a problem just a few reminders from the locals that you weren’t allowed to camp. Highly recommend 10/10 even just for a dinner and sunset views
111396,1014502,2,LaraAf,30/08/2020,"Wonderful to see, we didn't stay overnight because it was so airy the car was moving. There was no other car or camper, so we suspect that they may not allow you to stay overnight. But the sunset and the descent to the beaches spectacular. All wild."
111396,978362,5,HannaHbd,18/08/2020,"Rather 6/5 stars, so beautiful!! Small sandy path, accessible for campervans and smaller campers. Marvelous beach with few people. Police came by around 10am and kicked us nicely out."

111396,869502,5,Manjerico,14/07/2020,"Very busy, but we arrived late and still got a place. Although we had several neighbors, it was a very peaceful night. Wonderful view and “private” beach."
111396,796787,5,WeeRoam,20/03/2020,"We stayed there for a week during the beginning of the coronavirus confinement, this place was our home. We spent time on the beach, met very nice people, enjoyed the sun. We even found a public shower in the village nearby, just at the end of the road, you can walk there. I already miss our spot and we're planning on going back. It's sometimes a little bit windy but you can move back a little and there's a weird guy who kept coming and looking at us in the morning but we're used to it..."
111396,732485,5,missaline24,28/10/2019,"We ate here, beautiful spot, the beach accessible by the stairs is sublime !!"
111396,694307,5,ruben-lm,17/09/2019,Good access by dirt road without potholes. Spectacular views. Recommendable.
111396,681939,5,gomezlau,08/09/2019,"Spectacular site on the edge of the cliff with beautiful views. It has access to a cove through some stairs and way to walk the Vincentian Route. There is not much room, we were late and everything was already busy (3/9/19), but we slept in one of the ledges that are a few meters before arriving. Totally recommended!"
111396,678049,5,SolineRobin,05/09/2019,"Magnificent. A beautiful night with a beautiful sunset. Our best night so far. Some waste. Remember to take yours with you, and why not pick up some of them"
111396,644470,5,Derrickette,19/08/2019,"Small parking above a beach with a beautiful view, some places easily accessible, we spent a very quiet night in the middle of August."
111396,622684,5,phinie88,12/08/2019,"One of the nicest spots we have been to. However, this is due to the popularity of a slightly different place. When we were there, it was very busy and some people think that they can behave with tents, etc., as if they were in a campsite."
111396,617692,4,karramarro,11/08/2019,"Stunning views, very quiet. But there are not many places, since it is a track (about 3 km of track between farmhouses). It is not advisable for vehicles over 6.5 meters long. There is no defined place to turn the vehicle around. They have told us that the police usually pass and they kick you out of here."
111396,599450,5,AmAyVi,04/08/2019,Beautiful quiet view! In August there is already a lot of camper's but accessible only to vans no caravan or large camper. Ideal place to admire the beautiful sunset and have a good night.
111396,587145,1,Wintermute,31/07/2019,GNR asked us to leave in the evening.
111396,578833,5,jellejo,27/07/2019,"Most beautiful spot in Europe. If you’re reading this; you’ll regret it if you don’t go. We were the only campervan staying overnight, place for 8 I would say. Make sure to walk away from the lighthouse onto the other cliffs for amazing views. Please keep this one a secret ?."
111396,574982,5,carmenpenarodriguez,25/07/2019,"One of the most precious sites we have encountered. Cliffs and even dunes. Quiet and pleasant, 1 km from the town where there are shops and services. A beach below. Few people. Sometimes there is fog / fog in the first meters of coastline, then disappears with heat. PLEASE, PICK UP THE PAPERS AFTER MAKING YOUR NEEDS, in some more hidden areas it was really disgusting to pass, it costs nothing to clean and among all we can keep this place as wonderful as it is."
111396,569032,5,HeleneWi,22/07/2019,"Small natural parking, almost wild. At the edge of the cliff, magnificent view. Ideal between the lighthouse and the loans. To preserve, take back trash and hygienic papers please! No service."
111396,546651,5,robro,10/07/2019,"Absolutely stunning! The view, the almost private beach, the hiking path to the lighthouse... There are quite a few fishermen coming and going, but other than that this spot is super quiet. Toilet paper is starting to accumulate here and there. Please use a dry/ composting toilet! Bucket   Trashbag   Woodchips = 15€ // Clean and enjoyable nature = priceless :)"
111396,533774,5,Victorveron,30/06/2019,Superb place! Quiet night we were alone! Just fishermen at night and in the morning as well as some hikers but otherwise perfect place to sleep :)
111396,510428,5,alina1795,10/06/2019,Super nice spot. Only suitable for a few womos and vans. Beautiful view. Small beach and hiking trails. Highly recommended.
111401,2763304,3,Dariods92,19/05/2023,"the clearing is large and quite flat. But if you arrive on the weekend at night it is a meeting place for kids with disco music until five in the morning, mopeds and screams. Not recommended if you like silence."
111401,2706968,4,km1005,29/04/2023,"Good location within the town if you want to visit one of the many bars, restaurants or pizzerias in the area. I would echo the earlier comment that says not to follow google maps directions via the petrol station, as it takes you along something that is more of a wide walkway than a proper road - instead continue on up the motorway and take the exit just after the parking."
111401,2674050,4,Juanypatry,16/04/2023,"a place to drink bottles on weekends, but without any kind of problem... very quiet, with water and sports courts"

111401,2641909,5,AmandaAluja,05/04/2023,"Great, flat, quiet during the night and during the day, people walking and strolling along the river that is next to it. We spent two whole days with the motorhome. We took the 33 bus to go to Granada center. All perfect!"
111401,2607864,4,Blaidelta,13/03/2023,"I spent a very quiet Sunday night. Somewhat level. Be careful with Google, do not enter the Genil River promenade from the Galp gas station. On Monday morning it is full of cars next to the school, do not stand there. After all, calm down. People doing sports, walking the pet."

111401,1779506,4,FritzFitz,10/03/2022,"Okay for one night, but it feels like everyone from the village comes here with their dog to escape. Quiet is something else, but really ok for one night."

111401,1622852,3,Joss44,02/10/2021,"We spent 3 nights by the road. The site makes it easy to go to Granada by bike via the path that runs along the stream, 7 km to go to the cathedral. It is a place for evening walks and sports (cycling, running)"
111401,1215956,3,FredX,24/05/2021,"Spent a quiet night here on the large sand court. Alhambra can be reached by bike in 40 minutes, or by bus (59 minutes) Unfortunately, the place is used as a dog toilet by the locals. Nobody picks up the excrement of their darling ... It's like that in Spain and nobody cares ... except us?"
111401,799606,4,Pequenoplaneta,25/04/2020,We stayed on a Sunday night in February and it is quiet. There is plenty of room.

111401,425560,4,chavilin,29/01/2019,Site highly recommended.
111404,2457727,4,Montse07,23/10/2022,We have been at the bottom of the parking lot and we have been great. A lot of movement since it is one of the closest car parks to the center but we have found ourselves safe. You can find large spaces to park. It has no services.
111404,2287729,1,masqcamping,23/08/2022,"Do not park here, very dangerous due to robberies and cars are always parked, it is better to park in the Fornas neighborhood, on the sand esplanade next to the Mossos (Police)"

111404,2220073,1,gerardtarrago,12/08/2022,"It is better that no one spends even an afternoon there, I no longer say night because with the levels of crime there are, no one considers spending the night there. Avoid sleeping there and in any area of the old quarter."
111404,1217027,1,JOJUSA,25/05/2021,Parking poorly indicated to arrive and the spaces poorly indicated and occupied by other vehicles so we left and the city council would need to devote a little more interest to it.

111404,450318,1,Europetraveler,07/04/2019,Entrance to parking is via a narrow street. Once we arrived we discovered that all places that are reserved for campers were occupied by cars.
111404,425528,1,FamilyMaspairet,29/01/2019,7 exclusive places for motorhomes and mostly occupied by cars. The municipal police of Valls makes deaf ears to complaints and do not fine cars parked in those places.
111418,1560283,3,nodetenerse,08/09/2021,"Nice and peaceful, but to sleep here it feels a bit desolate... there is little water and it is not fully bathable..."
111418,1497285,3,LaPatoneta,22/08/2021,"Somewhat dry this summer, good access with AC and a shady spot. Ideal to spend the night but with hardly any water, the bathroom is prohibited and without services, it does not seem such a good option to spend the day."
111418,1079032,5,rre372002,02/10/2020,"Quiet place to rest. There are no services, just an untreated water source."

111418,516210,4,Mawa000,15/06/2019,"It is a very quiet recreational area, during the day there are few people and at night we have slept alone. Without services, the source at least now, brings little water and is not certified as potable. You can make a path called The Water Route that runs through a very beautiful swamp."
111418,476507,4,Alma05,05/05/2019,"Recreational area without services, only a fountain at the entrance of the area. Very quiet place with lots of hiking trails and a beautiful reservoir. The village is about 2 km with all services."
111426,3258270,4,geln19,04/09/2023,The only thing we didn't like was that the entrance was not protected...
111426,2886634,5,lunaalonso05,24/06/2023,"A spectacular campsite. The new bathrooms, laundry area and a social dining room, where you have to make grilled meat. Pool and shadows. We recommend it 100%"
111426,2757550,5,BigOE,17/05/2023,"Fabulous campsite, showers and toilets are amazing!!! Everything so new. Pitches for campers are large and spacious. Loads of biking and walking tracks around if that your thing. Really good value for money €19 for 2 adults, camper with electric hook up. Would recommend"
111426,2755265,4,FelixIzquierdo,16/05/2023,Cozy and correct campsite. Very neat and clean services. Spacious plots. Ideal place to visit the beautiful town of Valderrobles and Bajo Aragón.
111426,2524185,5,Geejay,18/12/2022,"This is the third time we’ve been here. It’s one of our favourite sites, especially since it has excellent facilities with lovely hot showers. One drawback is when it rains the ground can become puddled and soft, particularly the upper area. Good walks from the site, including the Salt or Valderrobres by the road or by Forest tracks. Cycling on quiet roads, for both mountain bike and road bike."
111426,2414735,4,Doraylua,30/09/2022,"Family and very quiet. Wide, flat plots, with electricity, but there is no separation that gives privacy; the floor is gravel. There is one area that is more shaded than another, but AC and campers with raised beds fit well in both. Good services, everything new and clean. Heated bathrooms. Dining room with 2 butane burners and a fireplace for roasting. Only 1 drawback: sometimes it can smell like pigs but it is tolerable"
111426,2373321,1,jesusgv,15/09/2022,too expensive for what it offers € 24 per night a person without electricity
111426,1448940,2,Okume,13/08/2021,"Unfinished campsite, several buildings under construction, the pool far away, no shade. 2.5 km from Valderrobres. In the new esplanade, trees are two years old and do not provide shade. Although it is cheap for little more, the campsite located in Beceite is much better, without a pool but with many natural pools in the town."
111426,1361865,4,Remolin,25/07/2021,Camping with very friendly service and staff. Little by little they are reforming it to fully equip it. Peaceful place
111426,1209270,1,titounne,21/05/2021,"We spent in this campsite, everything was under construction and far from finished. No location with shade. When we arrived we were made very welcome, we got settled in a pitch and when it was time to connect the electricity, everything to jump, only 6 amps. Not possible to put the fridge and hot water. We asked to be able to put our plug on a plot a little further that had 10 amps. The owner told us that we had to move our CC knowing that right next to this plot of workers would come to work there. We refused and left. We did not see anything else, but the campsite is by the side of the road, nor the sanitary facilities. We found another campsite not far away which is a real haven of peace"

They are working hard to achieve this."
111426,769665,5,Carla31,18/01/2020,"Family camping and quiet. The facilities are perfect, new services, clean and heated. It has a social dining room with barbecues. The plots are very wide.

The facilities are very new and has a swimming pool, (a little left) three beautiful tipis plus bungalows and plots apartments. The bar ... are only chairs, there is no bar or interior space and camping is not recommended for hot days because the trees are small and do not provide shade. In a few years this campsite promises."
111426,647974,2,Tarantina,21/08/2019,"It is a campsite that is under construction, or so it seems, the trees are very young and there is no shade, the pool is very small and was quite dirty, the man who served us quite nice. The perfect sinks. I think it is very expensive for the services they offer you."
111431,499627,1,mario43,01/06/2019,"Parking only during the day, do not spend the night, you fine the urban police, so we have taken a walk and we have gone to the park of the Anoia River that is very quiet at night and without problems."

111436,1782559,1,peperaul,13/03/2022,"It has huge potholes, at night there is a lot of noise because it is next to a busy avenue, also very annoying the noise of large trucks entering and leaving the parking lot very early. It is close to the bioparc."

In the morning it was busy, because of the roundabout next to the parking spot, but in the evening it was quiet. Nice park close by it.

111436,1629941,2,JensHansen,06/10/2021,"We parked for some hours during early afternoon with no problems. Felt insecure by leaving the camper behind, though.

111436,1545113,5,montydj,04/09/2021,"Perfect at any time of year and a very good option to visit Valencia, since it allows you to park without the hustle and bustle of the center, it is not totally flat but it is just a step away from the center by cabify or taxi, in front of a gas station with everything"
111436,1387975,4,RN7,31/07/2021,"Location a little noisy and very dusty but safe and very well placed (cycle path to go to tourist places, Mercadona accessible on foot ...). Several nights without a problem."

Great to go with the bike anywhere in Valencia. Firefighters, Police and hospital nearby. With a fairly discreet van without camping we have been able to stay for several days and nobody has bothered us."
111436,1185563,5,Meuler,04/05/2021,Perfect for a bike tour from the zoo through the park to the city and the museum. So right at the roundabout it is also quite safe because there is a lot of traffic. Fit all sizes WoMo on it. Easy entry. But unpaved loamy.
111436,1121716,5,faurys93,17/12/2020,"It is a large dirt car park 3.3 km from the city center. Considering there is hardly any closer option, that's already good. We stayed there for 2 nights with our 6m integral without any problem, going for a walk all day and returning at 9pm. We share the parking lot with buses, trucks and cars during the day. A bit noisy at night (near major roads)."
111436,1041822,5,montydj,11/09/2020,"Excellent place to visit Valencia, open field in front of a galp gas station with a large cafeteria with a socket to charge with usb or plug in the morning it opens from 6am"
111436,753596,4,xondi,14/12/2019,"Taking into account that throughout Valencia there is not a motorhome area, this is a gift. It is a wide open field even for a trailer and nobody will tell you anything. It is like a patatal, but it is in good place to visit the Bioparc, the Carrefour, the Parque de Cabecera, fill up gasoline and of course approach the center. Years ago it was a junkie area, now it is quiet. Next to it is a fountain"
111436,452075,3,JessicaH,10/04/2019,"Since we visited the Bioparc with the Womo we found here a great parking possibility. The Bioparc is a height restriction for a maximum of 2.20m. The parking is very uneven and probably not suitable for the night, because there is a lot of traffic."
111436,440114,4,The.Wicksy.Wanderers,15/03/2019,"Large, open space to park a large motorhome. It was busy due to the fiesta. 45 minute walk into the centre of Valencia."
111440,2609654,5,cindyy66,14/03/2023,"Really nice location. At your disposal picnic tables, a barbecue and a nice view. Room for several large campers. Toilets are in the parking lot a little further down. Rather quiet, with the sound of birds."
111440,2582345,5,mikelbv,18/02/2023,"We moved from the sanctuary parking lots here because there is no coverage or internet there and here it is. You are also more isolated, in the middle of nature, with tables and barbecues. Good views and set back from the main road."
111440,1745552,1,Lamaaathou,01/02/2022,"Closed on February 1, 2022, for works it looks like"

111440,859096,3,rvanvugt,10/07/2020,"Nice spot, but still closed. In addition a park ranger told me that's forbidden to stay overnight here and at any other parking in this natural park. Use the parking of the sanctuary, that's tolerated."
111440,432499,5,jkroon,23/02/2019,First we parked at the sanctuary 200 m from here. But it became a bit too crowded with regular cars so we moved here. It’s really quiet and in the evening it has longer sun hours compared to the sanctuary place.
111443,2222510,4,alcorte4x4,12/08/2022,"a quiet place to spend night and day, idea for 4x4 or small vans, little space for caravans and access is not suitable for ac no problems for small vans"

111443,1398927,1,zigalpt,03/08/2021,"The place itself is very nice but the road to get here is worse than horrible (forest road with many holes and up and down)! We came with a ""normal"" car but I wouldn't dare coming here with my van. But if you really want to come here, make sure you come from the side of the dam and not from the village of Carril. In any case 4x4 recommended."
111443,1125459,4,leaamelie,29/12/2020,"Very nice and quiet place for the night, right on the water. However, the approach through the forest is adventurous, and best only for off-road vehicles. In rainy weather it is not advisable to place yourself on the meadow. Our tires spun in the mud and we found it difficult to get away."
111443,1101268,4,AmaniMichael,21/10/2020,Location on dirt road next to the bridge. quiet at night but in the morning bickers and hikers. Good for a night.

111443,441753,4,mikitch77,19/03/2019,"The place is idyllic, at the edge of the water, near the bridge and under the eucalyptus trees. A quiet night. But more than 1.5 km of unpaved and chaotic road; to proscribe in rainy weather. With an integral of 6m, ok. Longer, avoid. Place right with table just before the bridge."
111443,427008,4,romeo,06/02/2019,"Superb place but beware of access, depending on which side you go there, strongly discouraged to more than 6 m, strong descent with rut and turnback complicated to go up"

111450,1190282,1,hasenteufel,09/05/2021,This is more of a parking space for hang-gliders. Disposal pit disgusting. Dogs pee and throw up freely on the square. Bark. SP unkempt very much weeds. lots of flies. Parked caravans and mobile homes spoil the place that would have a beautiful view of the finca. In the evening there is a barbecue and there is smoking. Great bar with a trustworthy checkout and a small pool. 14 € expensive

The tap is a pulsar, which is somewhat uncomfortable, but it has all the services well designed and you have to reward that there are towns with initiatives like that! Thank you Llagostera!"

111453,431792,4,Les4Korrigans,21/02/2019,"The place is impeccable. You are 5 minutes from the city center and there is a Mercadona next door. Only downside is that at the time of writing this comment the area does not seem in use. A little boy told me where I could fill up with water cans (it does not bother me but if you are 70 years old, you never know). Thank you to the town hall and the city!"
111462,2750813,3,JB22,15/05/2023,"Like all car parks in the area at night there is a lot of movement of cars and people at night! But this particular one is the one with the least movement!

111462,2534471,4,Furgo_time,30/12/2022,"Quiet place, near the sea. There is traffic of vehicles but they do not bother. It is a natural park, but in low season they allow parking."
111462,2421416,1,D_O_C,03/10/2022,"If you park here or in the many other parking lots, it's your own fault. It's legal but dozens of men driving around, some robbers, some sex seekers. Completely fucked up forest. The beach is reasonably clean for the port, bus into town every 20 minutes. CP is better than - safer above all......"
111462,1789831,1,ComplicesDuales,20/03/2022,"Filled with men cruising, it looks like a gay hangout. After reading the comments of people who have had their camper stolen in broad daylight, we decided to leave, and men kept passing by near our vehicle who seemed to be looking for sex."
111462,1679052,1,daphneevallet,05/11/2021,ultra creepy
111462,1644191,1,Thork,14/10/2021,I do not recommend. Isolated place with degraded appearance. We didn't stay.
111462,1511802,1,zuliettah,25/08/2021,I would recommend avoiding this place no matter if it's day or night. we've stopped there just to prepare our food and there are plenty of weird people passing around in circles and looking at cars. ideal spot for a robbery
111462,1228454,1,teaa_travels,31/05/2021,"Dont park here!
Our van was broken into, and money and wallet was stolen.
It was a sunday and many people were here but it still happened."

Turned the chair, entered and stolen money and electronics. We didn't notice the start of the break-in, but then my partner woke up and screamed. The burglar has fled"
111462,601682,1,Tmgp,05/08/2019,"We parked only during the day, so we could take the bus to visit Valência. When we return around 5pm the A/C was been stolen. The 2 back windows were broken, and stolen our electric skooter from inside the A/C."

111489,2527154,4,CurlyLoca,23/12/2022,"comfortable place to stop with great volume. We stopped during the day to go to La Tejita beach (nudist area by the way;)... I suppose that at night it would also be fine, although we must bear in mind that there would be some noise from planes that pass nearby and from the road"
111489,2511666,3,slqsh,03/12/2022,"Pretty dirty, noisy and not even a nice view. You can expect way more better than this spot. Super fast internet thanks to the airport very close."
111489,2504920,1,WHoney,25/11/2022,"A must for every autobahn romantic. Even at night you can listen to cars of different engines. Also: If you like windy places, you will feel welcome and particularly comfortable. With a bit of luck you can also hear airplanes."

111489,1883806,5,FlopoNoword,11/05/2022,"A lot of parking space. Close to the beach and right in front of Montaña Roja.
During daytime, the parking is quite full and there is some traffic nearby, but it gets empty and calm in the night.
Recommended for staying the night."

111489,1155537,5,PercyR,22/03/2021,"It's a simple sand parking lot on the street. But it is firm, straight and pleasantly calm at the rear end of the week. There are beautiful paths for jogging, hiking and walking. Many dogs can also be found. The parking lot is very suitable for dog owners. The beach is amazing. If you have no problem with bare skin, go all the way to the left on the mountain. If you want more peace and quiet, look for a spot on the spacious rest of the beach. Even if it is partly windy, you can swim very well in the water. We wanted to stand here for one night that turned into a week."
111489,1130874,3,nessus256,15/01/2021,Loud because of the street and a lot of people come and leave because of the beach. But the place ist ok
