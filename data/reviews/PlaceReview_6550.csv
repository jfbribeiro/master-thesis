86664,1503145,3,valparking77,23/08/2021,"Nice place and good to swim in the middle of the vineyards. Some people came for a swim, and owner of the vineyard on a tractor said hello. There is a association it seems, living in tents. Some people went to have some drinks at night but nothing to report.  Place is quite dirty even if there is a place for the garbage."

86664,654138,5,Emil69,23/08/2019,"Exceptional beautiful place, very quiet. The road to this place seems to go a bit narrower but is perfectly achievable, even with a larger motorhome. Many opportunities to stand, both shade and sun."
86664,588665,3,LudwigsOdyssey,31/07/2019,Beautiful place but sadly lots of rubbish around so spoilt the experience. water is cold but refreshing on hot days... Peaceful enough night.

86664,335653,4,ellenguaje,15/08/2018,"The narrow but asphalted road, when you think you've already lost you arrive. Incomparable framework. you can swim in the river, in the morning two cows come to graze and have tables to eat"

86671,796353,5,NFreitas23,17/03/2020,"Quiet spot during the night. Nice view to the lake and sunset. The sunrise you can see it very nice from the bridge. Also two picnic tables. Even we had nice ""neighbors"" in that day. Recommend"
86671,644510,5,aureleETmika,19/08/2019,Superb spot. Flat and quiet. Rocked by the singing of small animals. Roadside but inland with very little passage. Beautiful sunset.
86671,488080,4,savethefreak,19/05/2019,"Nice enough spot, nothing to see, farmer drives past to his field. Otherwise very quiet place"
86677,2663067,1,FranVan07,11/04/2023,Eye!! Civil Guard very pending in the area! They fined us for being with the camper at night!!
86677,2663054,1,oldtravelvan,11/04/2023,Increasingly restrictive. We were fined for spending the night… Better to stay in Oriñón.
86677,2440062,1,mariaitomeu,12/10/2022,You cannot access practically with any van since they have put a limitation from 2m
86677,2242544,1,julesundmitch,15/08/2022,You can't get into the village because there's a height limit of 2m. Too bad
86677,2103755,5,MiquiNavarro,21/07/2022,"It is a beautiful place, and it is not surprising that they will limit access to avoid overcrowding and disrespectful overnight stays. The barrier screwed us up, but since then we hit a ride from Oriñon. At least I hope that this is how the environment is preserved and we learn to be more respectful and less dirty"
86677,1905195,1,Zahira_ms,21/05/2022,Fatal! It is a beautiful place but they have put a gauge at the entrance of the town
86677,1489158,1,NickFF,20/08/2021,2.2m height restrictions.
86677,1489152,1,NickFF,20/08/2021,Restricted height now due to new barrier. Small campers only i.e. VW T5.
86677,1456133,1,AGFvan,14/08/2021,"Recently added a clearance at the entrance of the town, they do not want a Camper or motorhome"
86677,1452179,1,Bingen,13/08/2021,They just put up a barrier today.
86677,1407381,5,carolcica,05/08/2021,"Very quiet, 2 places to eat / drink a shot at 5 min walk, drinking water tap nearby also to fill the bottles. If there is more space in this small car park, continue the small road towards playa de Sonabia, many more spaces (but also many more people)."
86677,1377989,4,puxuxo,29/07/2021,"07/29/2021 divine beach, ideal surfing without services we traveled in a small camper there were 10 campers (no AC) you can spend the night. Very few people when we went, must go for times or days .. because it was very easy to access and park. Small place for picnic and 1bar (the whale) incredible views and to start the excursion to the devil's eye."
86677,1334936,2,boomcarvana,18/07/2021,Crossing the town very carefully is very narrow and has even traffic lights to avoid traffic jams. Better to leave before the town
86677,1329342,1,BegoVitoria,16/07/2021,"Difficult access through town, but not impossible. Parking is fine, except in the summer when the town becomes a dead end trap, as there is no parking for so many vehicles. 45 minutes it took us to go back out of town to look elsewhere. Not recommended in July and August."
86677,1329251,5,dami,16/07/2021,"Superb, hiked. attention the crossing of the village is very narrow! there is a second place near the restaurant but a lot of people. the place is sublime. it must be respected!"
86677,1005912,3,Suso72,27/08/2020,"Good place to spend the night, the only bad thing is that it is small, few places. The entrance into the town is complicated with large ACs but they pass, I take a large one and we pass. A 5 min walk to a very good nudist beach. Too bad we humans are such pigs and have a path to the beach full of papers. The beach is very good."
86677,968494,4,the_messybird,16/08/2020,"Nice parking lot behind the church with a view of the cliff. The road to get there is narrow but we got through it without problem. Access to the beach (""semi nudist"" beach) by a path at the end of the car park. We spent a quiet night there. Tip: get there early because it gets full quickly."
86677,943613,4,MartaManuySimba,09/08/2020,"Parking next to the Church which is reached by a narrow road although our AC is one of the big ones and we had no problem since we arrived in the late afternoon and found a place. then some vans arrived and it was completely filled, we spent the night there without problems. A 5 minute walk takes you to Sonabia beach (one of the most beautiful in Cantabria)"
86677,872623,5,Elhea,16/07/2020,"We wanted to make a stopover, we stayed for 3 days ... Superb, quiet place even in summer, despite a lot of traffic during the day. Direct access to the beach, nice walk to the end of the peninsula and a magnificent hike on the mountain on the other side of the beach (be careful to bring good shoes)!"
86677,853693,4,Unai10,07/07/2020,"Beautiful place with a mountain view and very close to a little crowded beach. We have spent a couple of quiet nights behind the church. There is a bar and grill nearby, approx 300m each. The Las Encinas grill has a spectacular view over the Oriñón beach. There is a fountain halfway to the grill."
86677,606853,2,cametes76,07/08/2019,Overcrowded and in the morning the police pass and call attention to some of those with tables and chairs outside ..
86677,605740,5,Platine27,07/08/2019,Superb! I confirm that the street is narrow to access it and especially as a facade renovation is underway.
86677,579226,4,Emma22,27/07/2019,"Quiet place to spend the night, close to the beach. respect nature and go with your waste ..."
86677,562945,3,bernard68,19/07/2019,"Very quiet once in the evening otherwise a lot of passage to the few houses and the beach. the beach is very beautiful and quite wild. Too bad the path is marked by handkerchiefs and other wipes: nature does not assimilate everything, thank you not to take it for a trash."
86677,416607,2,ben8719,27/12/2018,"Tight location to get into, but we still got in with 7m motorhome. Very quiet, great location."
86677,342089,4,jepebe,18/08/2018,"Nice and quiet, bbqs were shut down, 5 min walk to secluded beach. Nice and quiet, closed bbq. 5 min walk to the beach. Quieter than below"
86677,336259,5,yglpactat,15/08/2018,After 3 nights in peace. Beautiful hike to do in the mountains.
86701,3243683,4,EllenTermeer,31/08/2023,Dated: yes!! But a great campsite to spend a night.
86701,3102334,1,Anythinggas,08/08/2023,"Pool full of insects, sun beds locked, no sunshades even though 41c. Pool used by preschool holiday club 10-13.00 20kids then local teens all afternoon. Toilets and showers dated and dirty. Campsite in poor state of repair. Every afternoon locals descend on the campsite use pool and bar, owners son had all his friends over one night and partied playing loud music and shouting till 1.30am avoid"
86701,2929854,4,RichardMillar,06/07/2023,"We concur with previous comments. €12.80 for 2 adults, campervan and electricity. Great value. Peaceful campsite. Local children used the pool in the afternoon.
We could help ourselves to peaches, logan berries, beans, tomatoes and courgettes. Could do with a good spruce up to get the 5th star. I will come back if we pass this way again."
86701,2896683,4,buddysnipe1,27/06/2023,Set in a time warp but excellent value for money 7.40 euro a night including electric swimming pool opens 1st July great bat 2 euro a pint very friendly receptionist give it a go stock up before no shops

86701,2761312,4,danPennCoat,18/05/2023,"Stop at this small campsite on the road towards Porto. €10.80 for two people in a motorhome without electricity. Old but clean sanitary facilities, flat and shady ground. Very quiet away from the noise of cars. Worth the detour!"
86701,2759817,3,projectjumper,18/05/2023,"Faded glory, campsite is very outdated including sanitary building, swimming pool is green with algae, grass is high to the knees (some places are not). There are a number of permanent caravans. Owner seemed totally surprised when we arrived, he had not expected guests. Doesn't speak a word of English. That said, one big advantage: hardly anyone comes, so it's wonderfully quiet!"

86701,1431617,5,lakika,09/08/2021,"A luxury, for 10 euros the entire campsite for us, we arrived at 10 pm and the man attended us without problem. All facilities the truth, green pool but as it was not hot to bathe we did not care. He told us not to be in a rush to leave the next day."
86701,1413986,1,Plombart,06/08/2021,Bad reception. Very aggressive dog on the spot. Closed sanitary facilities. Exterior not maintained. Dilapidated swimming pool. To believe that this space wants to close.

86701,423363,4,alexb64,19/01/2019,"Cheap, simple, with clean sanitary facilities. It has an uncared for atmosphere because of the ancient faded signage and several even more ancient caravans and mouldy awnings. They wouldn’t be so noticeable in sunny weather when there are other people staying there. We saw it at its worst, on a wet day in January!"

86799,2044142,2,Nadine7790,06/07/2022,"Basically beautiful area and also a lot of nature. Locals told us that dogs are not allowed. Due to the little snow and rain in winter, the lake unfortunately has almost no water and there was a very strong wind. We decided to go again, no recommendation but can certainly be nice on other days."

We were alone there, perfectly clean place with a great view. In case of wind go down as close as possible to the lake on the right, you will be naturally sheltered by many pines and below."

When we arrived, a van was already installed and in the end there were only two of us on the spot. Absolute calm! You can even go into the water which has a pleasant temperature.

You can sleep, well: In a couple of holes that there are on the descent to the river, but the area is closed by vegetation and is quite bad. Or down, by the river, just take a car, and it is necessary yes or yes 4x4. But it looks like a path and we were not convinced to sleep there."

86990,2394754,4,chaharlotte,22/09/2022,wonderful sunrise. the cliffs invite you to have a coffee in the morning and it is relaxing to listen to the waves at night. One star less because you can hear the street where you park with the cars and some neighbors who are out in the evening. But otherwise a wonderful place for a night and a leisurely morning.

87069,3140683,4,antho1788,13/08/2023,Super quiet night and great setting! But the only downside was the water in the lake was very low and therefore swimming was not great. The water is very green.
87069,3048091,3,AdrienetEdwige,30/07/2023,"Nice place, late afternoon swim. But we couldn't stay on this evening of a hot day at the end of July, thousands of mosquitoes (and midges but that's not serious) attacked us. Flight was the only option despite the bomb."

It's changed ownership, so they're catching up. The showers have curtains, but they are individual. The WC are apart. The man who runs the bar is charming. He told us that in August he would make paellas. He is a cook and it seems that he knows what he is talking about"

87140,915309,4,FurgotxoM,31/07/2020,"Probably one of the most beautiful places to spend the night ... but in this location, overnight stays are no longer allowed (thanks to the envy of a nearby camping). It is a man's private estate where, paying € 2, you can stay during the day (from 10:00 to 22:00). Whenever we can, we stop by. You can sleep outside the farm but the terrain is not very regular. Bars and containers nearby."
87140,914502,3,Kenny_castil,31/07/2020,"We spend the night outside the parking lot, which is closed with a chain. But there is still room. We were 5 campers. Some wind. There are two bars but they open at noon"
87140,847196,5,Shiksa,03/07/2020,You can no longer stay there. There is a sign and the owner passes around 9pm. advising that you cannot stay. You can only park from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. paying the corresponding fee.
87140,827638,4,Pinillos,17/06/2020,"We spent one night without any problem. The campsite and the paid area (who owns the land and charges little to allow it to be there) were closed, so we had no unexpected visits. The spectacular views."
87140,673443,4,hinala,02/09/2019,"Spectacular views. We stayed one night and were very quiet. There are two restaurants next door. In principle you can not spend the night, but we were about three vans and a couple of ac. The next day he walked the civil guard but said nothing to anyone. We paid 2 euros for being there to the owner of the place."
87140,649946,4,lunezi,22/08/2019,This place is a dream! 2 euros to park on the grass right on the cliff - spectacular! - or free day parking just in front of the little restaurants - not flat. We didn’t spend the night there.
87140,635217,1,Iruya,16/08/2019,2e is charged during the day but you can only stay until 10 pm as the overnight stay is prohibited because the campsite has complained and the Civil Guard passes to fine you.

87140,599271,5,mandragoraaa,04/08/2019,"Nice and perfect place to go. They charge € 1 on weekdays and € 2 on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Ideal, both parking and the beach."
87140,577861,4,Bignugget,26/07/2019,"Nice field of grass over the sea. There is a prohibition sign for motorhomes, but the collector says nothing, so we've been great."
87140,566831,5,bichovito,21/07/2019,In addition to being a good place to park paying that low price has the t during Cazurro that eats very well. Walking from car park goes to Covachos beach or Porriño among others.
87140,553084,3,Roncho,14/07/2019,Spectacular view in a small meadow on the beach of Arnia. € 2 the holidays. being a parking lot of all types of vehicles and is filled on weekends. Out of season is a place of ten. Narrow access Ideal is to go to first or last hours to find a place. During the day you can have problems even to leave the parking lot due to lack of space. The owner is charming
87140,523134,2,Meera1,21/06/2019,Seems like a lovely spot and worth driving up for the view. But there is now a sign saying no campervans so don’t think safe to stay.

87140,314904,5,tato16v,04/08/2018,"Site to park perfect and for little money, if you arrive past the hour that is not the one that charges free feet. No one tells you anything about taking tables, chairs and making food. The beach of La Arnia is beautiful you can practice snorkeling and you have some paths to see cliffs. One of the cafes puts you food to take away if you do not want to cook."
87187,2397649,5,Sholkt,23/09/2022,"A site of 10. Super quiet, with beautiful views and surrounded by nature. It goes up a cobbled climb towards the quite broken viewpoint, so 4x4 and some skill is essential. The second hairpin corner (the right-hand one) has to be tackled well, it's steep and requires good traction and clearance. The rest is very simple. Difficulty: 6/10."

Stayed three nights here, just beautiful!!!"

87196,1064167,5,VivaLaPepa,22/09/2020,"Very nice and super quiet. At this time there are not even fishermen. It is easy to reach with the van ... you just have to go around a couple of times to find the place. Ledesma is beautiful, what a shame how decadent it is, there are almost no people left. We have done a wikiloc route of ten kms walking, I am wanting more."
87196,890461,1,Vanesa19,23/07/2020,There are some cement blocks that prevent moving parallel to the river. Nearby marking sites are difficult to access. I do not recommend it.

87196,400307,4,Tedward,28/10/2018,Stayed over for one night. Beautiful spot will parking right by the river.  Used by local fishermen so we parked to one side. Gravel track but plenty wide enough.   No services but the town is a 5 minute walk.
87196,380849,5,ViagensDaquiParaAli,24/09/2018,"Very quiet night, alone. Beautiful sunrise. As it is a fishermen spot, we moved early in the morning because we didn't want to upset anyone."

87216,2190821,5,checile,07/08/2022,The place does not lack charm and tranquility. Small corner of shade found. We were able to put our feet in the water. The lowered water level made it possible to pass the reeds. Superb view of the lake… and magnificent sunset. During the day a lot of flies entered the van…but they left as soon as the sun went down.
87216,2078144,5,eaxus,15/07/2022,Absolutely great evening. Highly recommended.

87228,2325952,3,korexpan,31/08/2022,"A bit far from Mundaka. We have left the camper to visit the town, we have not spent the night. There is a bit of unevenness from the parking lot to the town. We did not read the previous comments about theft, otherwise we would not have parked, although luckily we did not have any problem. It would be nice to enable some area closer to the town."

87228,681715,4,AlexAritza,08/09/2019,"Very close to the town through a nearby level crossing. People that deserve much to be visited. Few parking spaces, but Mundaka is very limited geographically speaking: on the one hand the sea and on the other side all mountains"
87228,559841,3,IPalma,18/07/2019,"Perfect to visit the town that is well worth a walk. Our 7 meters AC fit just. We parked in the lower part, on the right, because there is a lot of inclination up there."
87228,464858,2,miguelmlajara,23/04/2019,"We park to visit the town although there is a nice walk from Bermeo where there is a motorhome area. I do not recommend the site for cars over 6 meters. It is a ground parking at the entrance of the town with good access through level crossing. However, a local warned us not to park online occupying several places because the police would fine us. While there, the police went through the place several times."
87228,314532,3,cristinamateu,04/08/2018,Very quiet place to sleep. There were no AC or campers. There were only parked cars. We spent one night in the first week of August. There is no light or toilet. There are no shadows either but it sleeps very well.
87232,3255348,5,LucieGenet,03/09/2023,"Our first night in Portugal and undoubtedly the best. We were alone, at a water point, sheltered from the wind and in the shade thanks to the trees. Superb places to sleep. A garbage truck passed around 8:30. Nothing disturbing."

In the evening there were still a few people who were a bit louder, but at least that didn't bother me when I fell asleep. Young people came in the morning and celebrated. Throughout the day, people keep coming to get water from the well or to go for a walk in the forest behind. The square offers plenty of seating and the fountain with fresh water. There was another van there with us and we felt very safe and comfortable. It's better to park here than at the top of the swing, you're usually alone there."
87232,2150504,5,FriedrichMeloen,31/07/2022,What a great view during sunset. Quiet night spent with 2 other people in a car. Campsites and motorhome pitches in the area cannot match this spot.

87244,3183276,4,Hugal38,19/08/2023,"Great spot for people who want to practice kitesurfing and be close to the take-off area. Cons: a little dirty, mosquitoes and no view."
87244,3107352,3,barendanne,09/08/2023,Beautiful place and lovely between the trees on the water. Very busy with campers on 05/08/2023 and so many kiters that you can barely fly your own kite.
87244,2994823,5,WillSexton,20/07/2023,Great spot. Relatively hectic with campers when we were there but the spot is large so you still get privacy. Good kite spot (mind sea urchins!!). Peaceful at night. Loved it

GNR arrived in the avo looking for any chance to fine us, asking several leading questions, ended up arresting our neighbours who'd arrived during the day and had their awning out and took them away in police cars! Portuguese campers that did an Easter holiday camping party the night before got away no worries"
87244,1817901,5,gajettelaiv,12/04/2022,Amazing. There are countless spots to give you a little private spot next to the lagoon. Let's take care of places like this. Keep it clean.

Clean enough place, try to preserve that. Mosquitoes, it's a shame, but it's part of the place.

87246,1243834,3,bekler,08/06/2021,"A beautiful cove with showers and a permanent bar with a pk prepared for turizmo cars and no AC, there is only pk blue pay zone from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m."
87246,1013338,1,tomaslopezenruta,29/08/2020,"It is a small, sloping cul-de-sac that ends in a roundabout. Everything is blue zone and there are no places for AC. If there is space you can park on a hill occupying two parking spaces. It is not a recommended place. We parked further up a street where the blue zone ended. It wasn't great either, but there's less cost and it's free."
87246,424051,1,miticoarpege,22/01/2019,"Be careful, to reach it the road is very narrow, not recommended for large vehicles. When you arrive you find only 2/3 flat seats, the others are on the very sloping road, difficult to find them free. All in the shade, no solar panel. Park at the port is better"
87246,411539,4,welters,02/12/2018,"Quiet place located on a beautiful beach, no park fees had to be paid anymore"
87246,342368,4,Febus6433,19/08/2018,"Even the surveillance service confirmed it we can stay overnight it is tolerated. But then it's hard to get a good spot because between the beachgoers who leave the parking late and the fishermen who are there all night, not easy. And very noisy, there is an activity all night."
87246,340326,3,msalvado,17/08/2018,"Blue zone, comfortable to park, flat, 500m from the cove. Near the sea there are only 4 squares and they were already full. Beautiful cove"
87377,1740825,3,LosNanos,25/01/2022,"There is an esplanade of land with a little unevenness, however it is salvageable. You can spend the night very well and it is advisable to visit the neighborhood"

87473,2701737,4,Shibainu,27/04/2023,"Nice quiet place with drinking water fountain (Aqua potable). We parked to the left behind the chapel, loud music on the other side. The highway is barely audible."
87473,2698019,5,danaepm93,26/04/2023,"We spent 1 night. Services only 1 source. The best thing is to go a bit into the olive trees and find a flat spot, if you park near the road in the morning a lot of cars pass by and a lot of people park. When we moved away a little we were very good. No overnight signage or parking, no one bothered us. One of the few places that has shade."
87473,2631850,4,wearesama,31/03/2023,"We have spent two nights without a problem, that is if the noise of the road is heard and there is a lot of garbage on the floor (cans, glass, paper...)."
87473,2604613,4,protector,10/03/2023,"It is difficult to find a flat place, many people come to stand. Near the highway is quite loud. The night was well spent. Grilled in the morning. There are more places a little further on."
87473,2570925,4,FredFlintsone,07/02/2023,"We spent a quiet night. Garbage cans are available, a little further there is the possibility to get rid of gray water & fill up with fresh water!"
87473,2376241,3,Enjee,16/09/2022,"Large parking lot very very steep but empty. Lots of locals come to fetch water (not really a tap, so it's impossible to fill). Quite noisy. Be careful however the GPS point is wrong, the place is a hundred meters further. access OK HGV 10m"
87473,2361239,4,tterry,11/09/2022,We spent here one night without any problems. A lot of picnick tables and grills. Water and garbage down near the road.
87473,2198762,4,MariaIglesias12,08/08/2022,"Super quiet, day and night. With garbage, drinking water, and picnic areas in the pine forest. Very good option to put the hammock and spend the day in nature. It is steep, but you can find something more or less level, especially if you enter a little more into the pine forest on the left, where the water is."
87473,1793751,2,Damartinezcon,24/03/2022,"Horrifying, there were a lot of people doing strange things, then there are few flat spaces, almost everything is inclined."
87473,1791687,4,RobyKnoerich,22/03/2022,Very good parking lot with unfortunately a little crooked parking spaces. Driveway no longer in the best condition.
87473,1728229,4,walterontour1,06/01/2022,"We stayed 7 nights and had no problems. But there are hardly any straight places. One is in the top right of the church. There are grill facilities everywhere which have been used by some people. There is water. Small trash cans too. Nevertheless, there is unfortunately a lot of rubbish in the bushes."
87473,1454251,4,dashiabordo,14/08/2021,"Quiet and ideal place, one of the best places we have parked, with a drinking fountain. About 2 in the morning we woke up for a party right next to the parking spot. For the rest perfect place"
87473,1301100,4,Carlikun,06/07/2021,Good place to rest en route with plenty of shade and a water source. in Google Maps it appears as pine forests of the springs

87473,780961,4,Erio93,15/02/2020,Nice parking space with water source and hiking opportunities. Barbecue areas are rarely used in winter and then not in the late evening. Spent several quiet nights here.
87473,774528,5,Emmachia,31/01/2020,We returned to this spot several times. During the day it is busy with families and picnicking. Large barbeque pits for public use. In the evening you can hear the highway up the mountain side a little and the wind blowing through the trees. The spring water is part of a chain of natural springs and is delicious and free. Lots of space...but perfect level space is rare.
87473,755342,4,eburton,20/12/2019,"Great spot, lots of choice of places. Some unlevel spots but fine for campervans. You can hear the nearby road but that didn’t bother us. The water is at the front near the entrance, get in early as there was a queue of locals to use the tap!"
87473,752243,5,savetime,10/12/2019,"Excellent! Just spent two days and nights here. Friendly locals enjoying the holiday weekend... having barbecues, picnics. Some cars arrive... one or two... arrive after midnight, couples, friends in cars parking up to listen to music, smoke but not leaving their cars. Got lots of work done online... 4g signal so Spotify, Netflix, e-commerce all good. Good walks all around. Drinking water. Ace."
87473,733861,3,LauraRenato,30/10/2019,"Nice place, unfortunately a little louder here. We recommend to drive behind the church not to park directly on the street. Some small beautiful barbecue areas."
87473,474294,3,Garyvalou,03/05/2019,"The site is pretty with lots of birds, it's true but horribly noisy. Between the national below and the highway above. Only 1 or 2 places flat the rest on a slope. Suitable for troubleshooting for a short night of transit but no more."
87473,432335,4,Maccha,22/02/2019,"The gps stops about 100 meters before the air. It is located on the right, where there is a church and olive trees. Very nice area, quiet even if close to the road. Few places on the flat, you can park under the olive trees or if you have a large vehicle near the barbecue. Source of drinking water, garbage cans. ATTENTION in the pinewood presence of processionaries, lethal for dogs!"
87473,429483,4,ekiben,15/02/2019,"In low season and weekdays, it was very good for us and our cc. A lot of car noise but we are in town. And full of green parakeets in the trees!"

87562,2647293,2,IKERMAN,07/04/2023,"Nice place, although being next to the river it is impossible to be away from so many mosquitoes. And to curl the loop, 4 vans have come together with a tent and music that is too loud without respecting the 3 Motorhomes that were a shame, at 24 at night we had to leave. It's a pity that people don't know how to live together."

87562,2580340,4,popemonica,17/02/2023,We spent one night on the way back from Almeria to Bilbao. We arrived at night and parked in the car park instead of in the area since we made a mistake. The area is behind a prohibited sign that at night is not very good. Very quiet and perfect place to spend the night.

87562,2458332,3,Caravanadominguera,23/10/2022,"About 300m of open path next to the river, with geese and a couple of very nice downspouts. The area has a prohibited and under erased it says ""except motorhomes"" it is well compacted land so if it rains it does not seal. The bad thing is the branches of the trees, I imagine they will be pruned soon. The fantastic overnight, super quiet and illuminated with lanterns. The bakery does not open on Sundays."
