97508,1794595,3,marloucl66,25/03/2022,"Magnificent view, charming village... but the villagers moderately appreciate that we squat their parking spaces. We had a peaceful night, but we won't do it again out of respect for the locals."
97508,1743573,4,AliciaBarba,29/01/2022,"Four parking spaces in a very picturesque town that is worth a tour. The views from the parking lot are very nice, and we have felt very safe."
97508,388066,2,nickmawby,05/10/2018,This is really a parking area for residents. Quiet out of season but would not be appreciated in summer.
97508,350990,3,LiseLM,24/08/2018,"Ideal for a picnic stop. Adorable little Basque village. 4 places on flat ground. Nice view of the mountain. A fountain. No commerce, except for an inn. Animated evening: meeting place of young people."
97511,1309929,3,abravo,10/07/2021,"Good parking to do the route of the Xurbeo waterfalls. As a parking lot, very small for motorhomes and inclined to spend the night. We have done it but it was not difficult to take a place that was not bad."
97511,1277724,3,jorgeaz84,26/06/2021,"It's fine to do the waterfall route but I don't recommend it for the night... Small, inclined and next to the road (although I suppose there will hardly be any traffic at night)"
97511,1048349,3,legcat,14/09/2020,"We spent the night with an AC, but it's a bit small ..."

Everywhere where vehicles are legally allowed to park."
97513,2756588,4,campagnolo,17/05/2023,"We were there in the winter. At this time of year, free parking is well tolerated provided you remain discreet and do not clump together"
97513,2731477,4,AlexCamper83,07/05/2023,"Beautiful place 5 meters from the beach, they do not let you spend the night. At 1 kilometer there is a place to park the camper quietly. There is a supermarket nearby, restaurants. At night full of mosquitoes, when I say full it is full. Spectacular sunrise and sunset."

97513,1889648,4,liandou,14/05/2022,Great for spending the day by the beach. The only problem is the traffic noise.
97513,1868404,4,MariClaire,03/05/2022,"Spectacular place. You cannot stay overnight. Be very careful where you park… there are gravel areas and others with sand, with the possibility of getting stuck with the camper. The tow truck had to remove us… that is if he told us that it was very common for it to happen. Even so, everyone who passed by helped us a lot, what a wonderful neighbor."
97513,1457571,4,katana505,14/08/2021,"Now they won't let you spend the night, an environmental agent arrived informing us that from sunset until sunrise there cannot be vehicles enabled to sleep there, as I explained, you can stay to sleep with a towel on the beach but yes you get in a car to sleep and a fine ..."

97513,1330917,3,Anacleta234,16/07/2021,"Nice place but next to the road, a bit noisy. We parked next to the road and the guard said we can park but not camp (increase volume footprint, e.g. outdoor veranda)"
97513,1239573,4,JaviImbernon,06/06/2021,"There are few places for large motorhomes, but it is an ideal place to spend the day on the beach. You can not stay overnight, we also assume that it must not be pleasant due to the noise of the road."
97513,1227344,5,neiala,30/05/2021,"We spent the afternoon and had dinner there facing the sea and it was wonderful. Authentic peace, the building that is nearby next to the salt flats is very beautiful ... Seeing such a virgin place was a gift."
97513,1181592,5,JYE,29/04/2021,"The site is magnificent, it deserves not 5 but 25 stars, be careful when parking just before arriving from the town because it is sand and you get stuck"

97513,1092875,5,hbm151,14/10/2020,Excellent sunset. Great place to spend the day. No problem parking.
97513,1027480,5,FURGOMURCIA,05/09/2020,It parks very well. Good bathroom spectacular views. environmental agents pass by because you cannot park between sunset and sunrise
97513,947630,5,xemita,10/08/2020,"We spent the day there, as there is a sign prohibiting parking from sunset until dawn. it is not allowed to remove chairs, we saw how the civil guard warned the ac of our back because he had the chairs outside."
97513,906183,4,TeresayRuben,28/07/2020,"We really like to stop here and spend several days, it is calm, it is not usually windy and it is not saturated. The only downside to the traffic at night."

97513,781477,5,nemita,16/02/2020,We arrived for breakfast and we were there until nightfall. No problems ... just a lot of traffic on the road but we made life towards the beach. A great day!. We know of motorhomes that spent the night without problems in this area.

97513,625225,5,davidsuroeste,13/08/2019,"We spent the night without a problem, without taking anything out, although there were motor homes with awnings, tables and chairs, even unhooked caravans, if we do not abuse there is no problem"
97513,609893,4,roblouste,08/08/2019,Possibility to park all along the beach. The guardia is gone and did not say anything.
97513,571024,4,NikoBerrocal,23/07/2019,"Between the road and the beach, in parallel. We slept several vans and motorhomes. Between the church of Las Salinas and the town of Almadraba. Cars are heard, but not that too many pass. We saw the lunar eclipse from the beach. Eye, MANY MOSQUITOS! It is close to the marshes. Putting mosquito nets, no problem!"
97513,558188,4,carlosblay,17/07/2019,We spent the night of San Juan without any problem. To avoid traffic noise and the morning sun we stand behind the church.
97513,554455,1,abxo,15/07/2019,This morning from 6 to 7am Guardia Civil woke everyone up and took personal data (no fine though) who was parking on the beach road. They said overnight parking is not allowed and everyone had to move to the parking lot at Playa de Fabriquilla which is 2 minutes away which is the only site where overnight parking is allowed according to them.
97513,533643,3,aordu,30/06/2019,"To spend the day at the beach there is a esplanade next to the church ideal to have the AC parked. although some have unfolded awnings, tables chairs. At night we go to Cabo de gata."

97513,349821,1,Terranova,23/08/2018,I am from the area and honestly it is not a highly recommended site because the Law of costs applies sanctions in that area ... only for day parking is fine.Cuidadin where we sleep.
97513,348670,5,JuanPablo,22/08/2018,"Spectacular site, practically in the same beach we were one night and without no problem, there were many Motorhomes and campers ... To repeat"
97515,3291583,2,DavidPolo,13/09/2023,"quiet place away from the village, no services. It seems they don't want us in Castellar de n'Hug. Difficult access for people with reduced mobility."
97515,3197450,5,Mog-1,22/08/2023,"Great parking, let's hope the services end soon"
97515,3062245,3,marialed81,02/08/2023,"We have spent a quiet night. There is no service as they have not been put into operation yet. 10 minutes or less walk from the town, which is beautiful, and the views from here are wonderful."
97515,2651788,5,DaviddeTudela,08/04/2023,A fairly large car park that is being converted into a motorhome area because the services are not brand new. Very good views and a good atmosphere among people with dogs. We have come to this place through the sources of the Llobregat. Brilliant!
97515,2567101,4,Raquel.Carlos,03/02/2023,Very good place to spend the night with spectacular views and visit the area. It hurts that the services do not work and there is no garbage container either.
97515,2566693,5,danit493,02/02/2023,"A beautiful place, an impressive sunset, and very level parking. It is still about to finish but we have been very very comfortable, thank you very much for the space to the council of castellar de n'hug :)"
97515,2553888,4,vanner.vel,17/01/2023,Very quiet place with spectacular views! The services are not yet active. You can walk down to the town but there are 12 minutes of unevenness and no electricity. It is advisable to bring flashlights. Ideal for going to see the sources of Llobregat.
97515,2551223,4,Marinaestrella,14/01/2023,"Very quiet place with good views. The services are not active, when they are it will be a very good stop. We had a very quiet night."
97515,2546074,5,Djeigrau,08/01/2023,"Level ground with easy access through the entrance above (not the one on google maps). Spectacular sunset, a shame not to have seen the stars because there was a full moon. Next to the town where you can eat a giant croissant and go on routes. We spent two nights and everything was great. I don't know if they will finish conditioning the area but it would be very TOP!"
97515,2545366,3,maribelgt,07/01/2023,"Flat area above the village. Town 10 minutes away but with a big difference. In January 2023, the water services are still not open. There is no light."
97515,2529177,3,MeryC.S,26/12/2022,"The site is fine and has services, but it doesn't have a sad streetlight... and to go to town it's 10 minutes along the unlit road."
97515,2498257,4,bita1446,17/11/2022,"The site is very good. The access through which Google maps sends you better not take it, pay attention to the signage they have put up, especially if you go by AC. The day they start up all the services that it has prepared, I will give it 5 stars. Otherwise quiet site and a pleasant walk into town."
97515,2451587,5,ameliesat,19/10/2022,Super nice place with a great view! We spent two nights here and felt very comfortable. From here you can start super nice hikes and enjoy the quiet mountain village life. Filling and emptying of water was unfortunately fenced off.
97515,2330223,5,IsiLloret,02/09/2022,"A quiet place, relax, when you wake up you hear the little birds, it is a place that is not chlorinated or cold in Berrano and when you go to sleep, when you sleep you relax, for sure Bolbemos loved it"
97515,2318430,5,Canoorr,29/08/2022,"Excellent place to spend the night, quiet, great to see the stars, and with coverage."
97515,2218914,5,KikoSuarez,11/08/2022,"A stopped area project. It is a conditioned esplanade, but the services have been left unfinished. The site is level, quiet and 5 minutes walk from the town."
97515,2212347,5,MarilinaRibas,10/08/2022,"A pity that the town hall has not yet finished installing the water, electricity and filling services. Several motorhomes slept there, and the leveling and the views, a 10. But it cannot be considered an area (although it is marked as such) if it does not have any service."
97515,2110921,3,Yolandamg,23/07/2022,"It is just an esplanade with an area project since I have been doing services for a long time but they are not in operation. They also don't have garbage, you have to go to town to throw it away. Otherwise very quiet and good."
97515,2081671,3,Bellato,16/07/2022,"We value it with 3/5 because it does not have any service, regarding the project it would be a 10 but for now it is waiting."

97515,1990728,5,Aimpe,19/06/2022,"Now it is a perfect Pk, because the services are still stopped. With a path to the village that is close by, we will repeat!"
97515,1972285,3,Squidge,13/06/2022,Quiet parking free over night. No services but nice views. We had the site to ourselves. The ground is compact gravel and larger  pegs do go in with a whack. Close to the town.
97515,1949344,3,elpuentedetito,05/06/2022,": - [More than a year ago and the services are not working yet. :-D The esplanade is large, has good access, is quite level and is close to the village."
97515,1792027,4,Ernes98,22/03/2022,"It hardly has any slope, it is wide, with incredible views, and 5-10 minutes from the town, where one cannot leave without buying its artisan producers, be it bread, sausage or wine, all 10. Too bad that the area continues without services, since it would contribute even more to spending more days of tourism in the area and shopping in the town."
97515,1776071,5,Cbonillo,07/03/2022,Excellent place to rest and enjoy the place.
97515,1747840,5,Jordi_Dolors,05/02/2022,"Very quiet and good views, too bad the loading and unloading facilities are not finished yet ....."

97515,1704111,4,PedroRaboso,05/12/2021,"Place next to the village, still without opening the services that are installed. We got a bit of snow and wind and they came to warn us from the village to go down to the parking lot of the center which is only for cars, to be more protected. many thanks to the town hall."
97515,1695254,4,bisbal10,21/11/2021,"We had a very quiet night. In total we were 8 motorhomes. Very nice place and well adapted to spend the night. As a recommendation, if you are coming from La Pobla de Lillet, do not follow the directions on Google Maps on the first left turn and continue one more stretch until you reach the next. We will not put the 5 because the light points and the water change area were sealed."
97515,1680024,4,Raulloji,06/11/2021,"We follow the instructions of Google maps and we get complicated, it is better to follow the indications of La Molina when you are 500 m away, you will avoid some seamanship maneuvers. We spent a night a bit bothered by the wind, but the views are worth it. They are installing the water and electricity, I hope they will be soon. then it will be 5 stars"
97515,1669557,4,guisaim,30/10/2021,A quiet corner with a very beautiful view. Currently the drain area is almost finished. Beautiful hikes in the surrounding area

97515,1643254,4,olpodama,13/10/2021,"Brilliant! we had a very quiet night. They fit between 20-30 campers- motorhomes. It seems that they will open a drain shortly, there is a part under construction. Authorized place to camp. Beautiful views, cows, horses ..."
97515,1610811,5,llunadana,26/09/2021,"It can be considered an area that I do not yet know has opened, a perfect place."
97515,1608080,4,lacampana,25/09/2021,"Flat and comfortable parking with easy access if you pay attention to the signs but coming in the Ripoll direction with the GPS it made us go down a street that is difficult to access for an AC and without signs when we turned around we found it, large with services that are not yet there in operation 5 minutes from town."
97515,1605710,4,Abril20,24/09/2021,"Great AC area! A 4 because the services are not finished, but next time a 6, :-P. It is very well signposted to get there, pay attention to the signs, and you won't have any problems. We went to ""CAL PLATS"" a shop of a lifetime, great deal and croissant GEGANT BUNISSIM! The people of the town are fantastic, thanks to them we make the night. We were told that today you can hear the deer braying and it's true! Curious to hear"
97515,1592948,4,MarkAm,19/09/2021,"I give it 4 and not 5, pk the area is not yet fully developed, large area for about 20 or 30 motorhomes with good access to the town by walking 5 minutes. What looks like the area for emptying grays is already cemented and there are also what looks like posts to empty the black water and fill drinking water as well as another post for electricity. Very recognizable, if it follows the signs and not the gps"
97515,1589069,5,ACgreen,18/09/2021,Flat and super quiet place 5 minutes from the town they are enabling a drained area and I imagine water Recommended
97515,1541005,5,ismafg,02/09/2021,Thank you Castellar de N'Hug for thinking of us! Great initiative that will definitely pay you back! Perfect place to spend the night. Still without active services but they have little left.
97515,1511938,5,thequeenscastles,25/08/2021,"Perfect for being there with beautiful views, well worth it, big and quiet"
97515,1487292,5,evamsa,20/08/2021,"We have a 7.50 car and the turnaround mentioned in another comment is not true. We have had no problem entering or leaving. Not yet operational. Close to the town on foot. And a favor I ask the campers that do not have a toilet. Please collect both the stools and the cleaning papers, it is for the good of all."
97515,1471223,4,LARANDONVOYAGE,17/08/2021,"It will be a marvelous area when the services start to work, they are not yet ready, I hope soon beautiful views and best of all the coolness and air that runs in the middle of August, I miss a container even though it is not yet in operation, as well as access to the town It is by road and without a shoulder to see if they make any direct or more protected access to the town. Congratulations."
97515,1420791,5,Elgolpeapg,08/08/2021,"An area with difficult access for long motorhomes, ours is 7.5 meters coming from the direction of campdevanol, it was difficult for us to turn, and to leave the area the same thing happened to us, the area itself is very good just a stone's throw from the town, the services are not there yet, but it will be a great area. Thanks to Castellar de n'hug for this initiative."
97515,1363067,5,ieiashs,25/07/2021,"Very good area, spacious and quiet, 5 minutes from the town. Services about to open (grey and black water emptying, filling and electricity). From here there are many trips by bike and on foot. 100% recommended."
97515,1313647,5,martajat,11/07/2021,"Very quiet Friday 9/07 night. Services are not yet active but when they do, the area will be 10. Very quiet and surrounded by nature. In the morning the cows woke us up, but it is the price to pay for sleeping in the wild. Thank you very much to the city council for creating a space for motorhomes. I hope that all of us respect these sites !!"
97515,1313012,3,SARANGDONGA,11/07/2021,"It's basic, good views if you pass the fence. But, there is one aspect of mobile phone that is not pleasant to the eyes/health. Today there are about 20 motorhomes. With that it is almost full. It is quiet, the town is half a km downhill or uphill, it depends. The town for a perfect day. You can do a lot of hiking. As they said, do not take the path down through the village, it is only allowed for less than 3 m."
97515,1304561,4,Emis46,07/07/2021,"Perfect. The services are in development... but good place. The road is far from the town, continue along the creek past Castellar and have faith that you will find it! The town was closed at 8 p.m., they did us a favor at a hostel for dinner."
97515,1301064,5,olgatleti,06/07/2021,"Services still not working, but the site is amazing ... wonderful views"
97515,1297228,5,fortuna77,04/07/2021,"Soon it will be able to be called an area, since it will have the emptying-filling point in operation and electricity working. Thanks to the city council for this service"
97515,1282018,5,Jounou,27/06/2021,"New Caravan area in Castellar de N'hug with emptying services, both gray and black and electricity, everything will be ready shortly. Large place with impressive views and surrounded by cows and horses grazing around. Located a few minutes from the center of Castellar where, apart from obligatory visiting Les font del Llobregat, buy the typical 1kg croissant."
97515,1265191,4,wiki88,19/06/2021,"Gokuonroad, they have currently installed, but are not finished, the services of water filling, gray emptying, chemical emptying and electrical outlets. We have spent two quiet nights. Thanks to the Castellar de n'Hug town council for this initiative. We will be back"

97515,1216511,5,vilanova,24/05/2021,Parking with spectacular views. Very quiet place and very close to the town. The only thing it lacks are garbage containers and it would be ideal to adapt it as a motorhome area.
97515,1189688,4,ismamzn,09/05/2021,Good parking to visit the town and the Llobregat springs. We also spent the night and were very quiet. Very flat.
97515,1188482,4,Albertlopez,08/05/2021,"We spent a very quiet weekend with a couple of ACs and vans. I give it 4* because it does not have services, but they are not necessary in our case either. Highly recommended for visiting the Fonts del Llobregat or taking excursions on foot or by mountain bike."
97515,1168929,4,elsdos,06/04/2021,"Very good location, close to the town. A better tip is to arrive on the Molina road. If it had water to unload and load it would be perfect."

97542,1515448,4,thepo90,26/08/2021,"Somewhat bleak, but very decent gravel place. The young girl from the check-in was extremely friendly and helpful, good English. Unfortunately, the employee on the morning of departure could not speak English. In my opinion, a single toilet is not enough. At least clean, but 50ct. 2 clean showers. 50ct per 3 min. Washing machine for a surcharge. Offers everything you need."
97542,1513754,5,AlessiaG,26/08/2021,Great pitch near Faro. Staff very friendly and helpful. In the afternoon we still had a lot of seats to choose from. Towards the evening the place filled to the maximum.
97542,1495418,4,NURIKA,22/08/2021,Very quiet and comfortable area. the only one but that you have to pay 50 cts for the shower and for the bathroom. I think that at least the service should be included. € 12 two people and van. Otherwise perfect.

I give ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ !!!!"
97542,1462003,5,neki9,15/08/2021,"Quiet and well-kept place. With fencing. It has electricity and water. The only thing that there is only a shower and a toilet and for both you have to pay. The pitches are spacious to put the table, chairs and awning. You have to go to the beach by bus or taxi, which cost € 5. Then from there there is a boat that takes you downtown for € 3. Shopping center near by car 5 min. some plot if it has shade. In general it is very good"

97542,376932,4,blanc.carole,18/09/2018,"I allow myself to temper the comments on this area whose keeper is actually very friendly, available and very welcoming. The area is however quite noisy because near the road leading to the airport, it has no showers or toilets and there are no shops / restaurants nearby. On the other hand, if you have bicycles, then I advise you very strongly to go in the Ria Formosa nature reserve: 16 km by bike (round trip flat without any car) in a grandiose setting, an absolutely breathtaking nature with as a bonus at the end a bridge that leads to a beautiful beach."

97737,1739668,5,unbalconnoche,23/01/2022,Spectacular place next to the lake that was created where the old mine was. It has no services but the town area is nearby. We only stop to eat and take a walk.
97737,1587324,4,Primpiratas,17/09/2021,"Lake beach parking. At 100 meters there is a tourist office. Somewhat uneven. Quiet night, waking up with the sun reflecting off the water. The area is kept very beautiful. From there the path to Memoria starts around the lake."
97737,1574675,4,lgte,13/09/2021,"I did not sleep, but it seems like a good place to do it even though it is under electrical cables. there are several parking areas. It is forbidden to go down with dogs to the beach area but there are routes to do through the mountains with them tied (or so it says on the sign). there is good Movistar coverage but not stable enough to work."
97737,1571403,5,amainar,12/09/2021,"Excellent place to practice water sports and very quiet for the night. Thank you Council of As Pontes. In the town there are all the necessary services for emptying gray, black and filling. a 10."

We put chocks on but the police, who passed several times making the rounds, did not come near to say anything. Everything is great. There is even a very nice bar-truck where they sell pizzas and drinks. The beach is spectacular."

97737,1493336,5,FuXerxes,21/08/2021,A very nice place to spend a few days. Whoever drives down the street can stand directly at the water and has a beautiful view over the lake. There is also an artificial beach that is well frequented during the day and even has a beach volleyball court. The police drive by several times a day to check that everything is okay.
97737,1455428,4,madeincangas,14/08/2021,Parking next to the reservoir. man-made beach area with showers. good place to spend the day and sleep. no services.
97737,1396908,4,SalvaCastilla,02/08/2021,"Access is through the roundabout at the Repsol gas station, not through the one indicated by the navigator. There is more parking further down than the app indicates, next to the lake. A wonderful place."
97737,1347814,4,Carlosmunoz,21/07/2021,"Very cool place, pity that there are no services for the caravan, but the parking is very good. The GPS leads wrong, it is the second roundabout, not the first. Where is the gas station, opposite is taken for the parking of the lake"
97737,1158122,5,jorconde,26/03/2021,Very quiet place ideal to be isolated. We have called the municipal authorities and we can spend the night without problem. ideal for bikes and long walks
97737,1003950,5,Luipi,26/08/2020,Spectacular place to spend a bathing day on its artificial sandy beach. There are many parking places that are also shared with cars. As we are informed in the beach bar they no longer close the doors at night but it is advisable to make a call to the municipal authorities if you intend to stay the night.

97789,1070305,5,MiguelCabral,26/09/2020,"The view is great! We stayed here for one night, and we really enjoyed it. There is one spot some meters downer that is more sheltered from the wind and from the road! However, this place worked out for us very well too! The GNR passed by us in the morning and didn't say anything. I don't know if they would have done something if there were more cars here. PLEASE do not leave garbage behind."
97789,1065459,5,HelmLeBus,23/09/2020,Very nice place on the cliffs next to a castle. Perfect spots for camping and parking with a nice rocky beach. There were no problems with the police.

Although when we arrived the night before the police had passed warning that it was not possible. And yet we have slept with more than 10 AC, Camper and tents. Incredible views."
97789,943317,5,novamoon7,09/08/2020,"A heavenly place to stay! Lots of space and a fantastic view! The road there is a bit bumpy and you have to see that you are standing straight, but we got through well with our Sprinter. No service."

97836,2947816,4,Marleenrit,10/07/2023,"Special place, it has something. However, on arrival you first have to clean up rubbish from the previous guests. A little further on is an old water mill, nice to walk to (2 minutes walk)."
97836,2761913,4,BBQontheRoad,19/05/2023,"A stream splashes and flows into the river. There is wild mint. Dusty, but you can bathe in the river. We travel with a Fiat Adria Twin. 6.5m long + bicycle carrier. Almost fully loaded. Turning at the bottom went perfectly. It was dry. To get back up it's best to turn on traction control and take a run up at the bottom of the last slope before you hit the street. Exciting but it went well."
97836,2713508,5,KerryAnn,01/05/2023,"Love this! we shared this spot with a local Fisherman who was so keen to see th3 van and very friendly. Didn't swim until later on,but rhe river was lush. Very private. 
The locals seemed to mainly gather on the other side. Walking distance to the main town."
97836,1841982,4,robert821,20/04/2022,Lovely little spot. Directions with Google maps took me in the wrong direction. When you get in the area- stop and take a good look at the map to work out the way there. Don’t take the village route from over the river as it’s very narrow and I scratched my camper wheel in the process because it was so narrow. the river had lots of frogs!
97836,814194,5,jacekpodroznik,01/06/2020,"Nice spot, clean and quiet, just in the morning some dogs barking on the other side of the river, it was nice tho :) thanks"

97836,477992,2,Geoff199,06/05/2019,"Such a shame - I dared not to take my 7 m van down the steep, sandy track to this location.  The pictures posted by the originator were so attractive.  
One of my Sat Navs wisely refused to direct me there but Navmii suggested going down the slope."
97848,3063606,5,Mimouche,02/08/2023,Excellent spot to spend the night. Indeed we vaguely heard the dogs in the distance but do not push it does not prevent you from sleeping. There really is a way to nab a spot in the shade when the sun is beating down. Superb city to visit a little away from the tourist paths. Don't miss the castle and the fort at the top of the hill ;-)
97848,2907798,2,Richard17,30/06/2023,Woken up at 6 a.m. by someone picking up the leaves with a blower. Dogs barking all night. Too bad because we wanted to visit the city.
97848,2606710,3,ElVeterano,12/03/2023,"Generally a quiet place to stay for a night, but campo dogs in the distance barking at 3am to 5am may spoil your night. An interesting town with a castle and some great restaurants. Swimming pool was closed but the restaurant was open on this Saturday night. Plenty of other eating and drinking places in town a short walk away."
97848,2539829,5,fonso66,03/01/2023,Great place. We spent 2 nights. Near the center. Nice town with a lot of beautiful corners. You can take a dip in the heated pool 30 meters from the car park. quiet and sunny.
97848,2518386,3,Titopomi,10/12/2022,Very quiet to sleep. 5 minutes walk from the center
97848,2356313,4,AnaOrtega,09/09/2022,"It is the parking lot of the sports area. Total tranquility. We stayed two days. Great and beautiful pool next to it Good restaurant in the pools, Beautiful and elegant town"

97848,1550174,3,Ralphdomi,05/09/2021,"We stayed there for 2 nights and that doesn't seem to be a problem. Superb municipal swimming pool right next door. We were able to hike after passing through the tourist office. Tip: have a drink in the bar open only at the end of the afternoon near the car park, after the swimming pool below. 2 beers 1 glass of white wine: € 3 and good music. Beautiful village. We feel good there."
97848,1092290,3,Laveloz,13/10/2020,"Good to park and spend a night. It is quiet, but if you park in the squares for this you will be on a slope, you must do it on one of the sides."
97848,875523,4,elysium3,17/07/2020,Perfect for parking and visiting the city
97848,781393,4,family04,16/02/2020,"According to Google maps, it is 1 CC parking lot but no sign indicates it. Good, level, no service. Movement during the day because soccer match, at 9:30 p.m., no one left, only one or two dogs barking ... all night. Town center at 500m on foot."
97848,405223,4,fbrunner,06/11/2018,We spent 3 quiet nights here. There is a bicycle service station nearby where you can get water. There are no other amenities nor public restrooms. Next to the supermarket Pingo Doce.
97884,3173151,4,DavidGarrido,18/08/2023,"Pretty good, busy but quiet at night and nice place, pool right next to it. More traffic in the afternoon. No problem with a nasturtium motorhome and a dog"
97884,3008145,5,profepatata,23/07/2023,"Complicated access as it is a narrow two-way road, but it is worth getting there. To spend the night in the exact place shown in the photos, it is recommended to ask permission at the beach bar. Also, if you notify them, they give you access at night to the toilets and showers. The place is wonderful with well-kept natural pools and you can eat well at the beach bar."
97884,3000014,1,Chrislan_at,22/07/2023,"Very narrow path. When you pass a car, it makes you sweat... I'm wearing a hood, and when I got there, and I saw the access ramp... I turned around where I could and took off. If you go with a nasturtium, you stick to the fixed branches, and the entrance is very narrow. I suppose that with a profiled or a camper, it will be easier."
97884,2908382,5,Maica978,30/06/2023,"Excellent large and fairly level car park. At night Eulogio who runs the restaurant leaves the women's toilet open for us. All a detail. It eats wonderfully. quiet during the week, on weekends how full everywhere. Tables to eat without having to consume. But it doesn't hurt to consume something either. It is just after the restaurant an easily accessible slope with shadows."
97884,2869869,1,Merchina,19/06/2023,"Very crowded in summer months, very narrow access and not suitable for motorhomes. Better the one on the other side of the river."
97884,2339870,5,solrrak,04/09/2022,"Ground esplanade just behind the bar. We spent a quiet night and ate at the kiosk/ bar. The access road is somewhat complicated. If you just want to go to the bathing area, it is not worth going here, parking is much easier from across the river."
97884,2232591,1,Patmorram,13/08/2022,We have not been able to sleep because they do not authorize overnight stays if you go with a dog.
97884,1837840,5,Irene35,19/04/2022,We have spent a very quiet night. Nice and very nice place. When the beach bar is open you have to notify to be able to park and stay overnight. Narrow access but it is easy to get there.
97884,1815114,5,andonimayo,11/04/2022,We have spent one night. Very quiet! Services were closed! Just like the bar that was also closed! For the time of year! The narrow access!
97884,1704729,4,Urbanfit,06/12/2021,"We have been two nights, the first there was a camper and the second alone. Yes, access is narrow but you can pass. We have a 7.5m AC and we have entered without problems. good place to do walking routes. We have been in the one that appears in the photo."
97884,1544641,5,Lolololez,03/09/2021,"Nice place, quiet at night. It is recommended to have a drink at the beach bar and ask for permission to stay overnight. Access with care no problems. Nice pools and interesting town. The parking lot in the photos is past the beach bar, that's the place. Clean showers and toilets"
97884,1092292,3,Lordexess,13/10/2020,Closed on the date of publication of this comment. Branches inside the bathrooms with closed bars. Probably by covid-19.
97884,955984,1,Onuzahori,12/08/2020,"Not suitable for motorhomes or large volume vans. The access road is very narrow and two-way. Large vehicles cannot enter the parking lot, it is not possible to make the turn. And the area that I have seen in the photos is just part of the narrow path."
97884,921995,5,Laufre,02/08/2020,"Good place, we have spent 2 very quiet nights. The access road is narrow and it was not very crowded, there was only one camper. You let us know at the chiringuito that you are staying in the parking lot and without any problem, they have told us where to better locate us. To spend the day in the natural pools and eat at the beach bar."
97884,669837,4,patricita,31/08/2019,Except for the guy who manages the place that is the town hall and does not like dogs the site is perfect. They leave the girls' bathroom open in summer and you have showers and shade.
97884,596209,4,CarlosB,03/08/2019,"Recommended site, if you go in the middle of summer it is better that you arrive in the afternoon / night to be able to park (especially if it is a weekend), you will sleep peacefully and more or less flat. The next day to enjoy the pool and if you want to eat in the restaurant, we had a good experience."
97884,584462,5,Neku,29/07/2019,Incredible area ... you have to let the bar know that you are going to sleep. Very quiet. Narrow double direction road.
97884,560859,3,Heleord,18/07/2019,A very nice place. But we have been in July and at night there was a lot of fuss.
97884,413769,1,JoMac39,12/12/2018,"We were this bridge of the Constitution and there are chains that do not allow to enter any of the two parkines there. At the entrance there is a small space but the cars use it to change the direction, so until the summer I imagine nothing."
97884,375406,3,esencia,16/09/2018,"We were the night of Saturday 15 September and the pool was no longer operational, without water, or showers .... the place very quiet and dark. We only sleep with another ac ... you only hear the water running. In the morning the neighbors come for a walk. This is about 500 from the center. Too isolated (for my taste)"

There is water and services in the back of the center. We give it 4 stars because it is next to the road and there is some noise although we slept well. Large park next door with basketball and soccer field for children.
97926,2313963,4,nomadazaca,28/08/2022,"A great car park to spend a day at the beach and visit the town, with great views. To enter, as the previous comments say, go towards the motorway and turn around at the motorway roundabout to be able to enter the parking lot if you do not enter through a prohibited direction."
97926,2167137,5,Escalam,03/08/2022,"Hello, as it says in the announcement, to enter this you have to go to the roundabout before entering the highway and thus there is no violation and it is more convenient to enter, it is a walk to the village, thank you Pontedeume for allowing be able to park"

97926,2095170,4,rachaelmharri,19/07/2022,"We spent the night in the car park opposite, next to the tourist office and adjoining a fabulous park to spend a hot day in the shade.  Brilliant for kids and dogs, basketball court, football, playground, picnic tables and plenty of shade.  Toilet and water tap behind tourist office.

97926,1512644,4,pepetrueno,25/08/2021,"We have slept three nights, although not in a row. As a place to sleep it is not bad, although very noisy from the road and dusty. Ideal for visiting Pontedeume and going to the beach. The left corner of the beach is Dog Beach."
97926,1487703,1,Yolanda76,20/08/2021,"The parking lot looked good and near Pontedeume, just crossing the bridge, but very attentive in an hour that we have been they have plucked us, the TV with amplifier included they have taken it from us and the drone.

97926,1336037,3,Marquesmm,18/07/2021,Large esplanade. Preferable leeward first thing in the morning or after dark due to the saturation of cars due to the proximity of the beach. It has no shadows but the beach is 100m away and there is also a space for PLAYA DE PERROS. Also right in front of a large park with picnic areas and swings
97926,1327905,4,Esther-Buka,15/07/2021,"It is an ideal place considering that it is on the side of a large roundabout, but there is a lot of room and to sleep it is more than enough and also 5 minutes walk you have a beach for dogs, Cabanas beach."

The Pb along this avenue is the direct opening onto passing cars and noise. Otherwise 3.70 E per day is frankly unbeatable for parking in the center with our vehicles. If the municipality could block the avenue at 11:30 p.m., that would be perfect??? No really ln last we only gave 2 stars but to visit finally it's great!"

The route to get there is not very good, but rolling slowly there are no problems, the entrance is dirt and with a lot of space, if you are careful you can enter.

98098,359069,4,T5Klif33FR,29/08/2018,"Very nice site, very quiet at night, open church, walks along the water, sanitary open even at night, picnic tables ... several parking in the shade. The flatter is that of the center."
98104,1981189,5,miguel87,16/06/2022,"we spent the night in the truck parking lot, it's quiet now it's still a polygon, because of the noise of the ships, then you have services for both sexes, they have to ask for the keys, we have breakfast at the bar, everything perfect"
98110,2985258,5,denisleclercq,18/07/2023,Incredible 1 night spot on the N2. Bar - restaurant BARBA AZEDA (on insta and FB) same super nice owners. Toilets separated from the restaurant open even at night. Playground AND cycle path on the old railway line. Yes this Horeca place uses the old relocated station. Near the highway but without any noise pollution
98110,2653883,2,ozewieze,09/04/2023,"Nice place but beware; not always calm. On the Saturday before Easter there was a lot to do at the restaurant, cars drove back and forth. When it hadn't calmed down at 10 PM, I left."
98110,2574072,5,Trottie,11/02/2023,"Nice place to spend the night in the parking lot of an old train station and use the welcoming restaurant / bar. A spotlessly clean separate toilet building outside next to the P. On day 1 after arrival, we drove the shorter route to Viseu, had a nice meal there in the evening, spent the night in peace and quiet and cycled the longer route to Santa Comba Dâo the next day after breakfast ."
98110,2444466,4,bullginas,15/10/2022,Very good place to walk along the greenway and sleep. Battery parking for 3/4 vans of maximum 6 meters. We slept Friday and quite quiet. There is a nice restaurant and bar next door. Just 800 meters from the main road.
98110,2255346,4,korrigan2001,17/08/2022,Place quite close to Viseu and ideal to spend the night there. There are toilets. Ideal for small van vehicles.
98110,1763250,4,kareldeherder,22/02/2022,"Wonderful place to stand if you want to cycle the Ecopista do Dão in 2 stages. 1st Stage 30 km and back, 2nd stage 20 km and back again. During the day some walkers and cyclists, at night we were alone. You have to be self-sufficient, there is nothing. In the background you can hear some traffic noises, but not disturbing."

98161,2622809,5,livingPacolife,24/03/2023,We loved this place! Its beautiful! The lake is so nice and you can take a nice hike. In the town nearby there are hot showers also. One note: the lake is just a lot for water sports so you will not be all alone on the world.
98161,2481062,5,Nando51,03/11/2022,Attention this place is Guadiana natural park and I was fined. €201.00
98161,1121303,4,zboink,14/12/2020,"Absolutely beautiful place to stay. But track must have changed since last reviews, as not accessible for any vehicle.
Struggled to leave the spot in my vw t3, slipping and scrapping the bottom. Would recommend only for lifted vehicles."

98161,488796,5,Fail93,20/05/2019,"Beautiful! Very narrow road with bushes, which scratch the car, but it went. When it rains, large puddles form. Steep descent at the end, but with small vans possible. :)"
98161,483027,5,yoyo2222,13/05/2019,"Very nice place by the lake, nice flat area with shade, easy swimming on May 10th. I was alone in the world. Easy access with my Volkswagen T5 van. Not suitable on the other hand for large motorhomes because a little narrow path (I cleaned the area of papers pee Do remember to bring your waste with you!)"
98163,2202350,4,pautroncho,09/08/2022,"the super slutty people, in front of me a green French license plate van, leaves, before leaving, cleans the whole van and leaves the garbage there under a tree PLEASE TAKE YOUR SHIT, nature is not your landfill, toilet paper you can put it in a bag it doesn't cost anything, in the end we won't have places to go because of prohibitions and I'll understand, HOUGHS! magical place"
98163,1470253,3,viensonlefait,17/08/2021,"Very nice location but we did not stay because really too muddy! The locals advised us to go further because we sink very quickly into the water and it is not easy, especially for children."

98176,2896806,4,Juditgp,27/06/2023,We spent the night here very well since in the area set up for AC on the other side of town it was impossible due to outside noise. Here we have been quiet all night. In the morning there is more movement in the parking area for people who work in the town

98176,625401,3,asturmano,13/08/2019,Adequate place to visit the town although it is a little more remote than the caravan area has no services and is a bit helpless. Good to stay if you do not find space in the caravan area but better for a daytime visit.

98176,429096,3,agnesfili,14/02/2019,"It's not pretty but it's 5 minutes walk from the town. Next door has a sports center where you can shower paying the entrance to the pool which is 4,21eu.

98195,2574862,5,3aufReisen,11/02/2023,"In contrast to the more northerly places directly on the lake, nothing is littered here and much less hustle and bustle (at the weekend). The road in the direction of the dam is blocked for vehicles by a gate. It happens to residents and employees. Free passage to the dam and the lake for hikers. View of dam and river."
98195,2570778,5,MaxiSole,07/02/2023,"A beautiful place for people who want nature and tranquility. Capercaillie during the day and an owl at night. The site offers a great view of the dam/reservoir. You can explore the area by bike and dog. Although the site is on a road, only a few vehicles pass. During the day anglers park, the nights are quiet. Thank you for this great place."

98195,1121905,3,stephyuup,17/12/2020,17/12/20 Not easy to find a flat spot. Plus there is currently construction going on right next to the “spot” so the noise from the employees and the machines woke me up at 8am. A few cars passing by from 7:30am also. Quiet at night but I would advice you to find another nice and more charming spot to spend the night...
98195,612498,5,AuroreDcs,09/08/2019,"After shooting more than 2 hours to find a suitable place, for lack of bad recommendations of park4night in the vicinity, we finished our search on this place around 1am.

98200,558924,1,esencia,17/07/2019,"I have been going there for years as a tourist, now a motorhome and it is the most restricted natural park in all of Spain. And well of lack towards them to promote tourism in winter. By not regulating they prohibit directly. Nefarious management. And with harassment of the civil guard, not only this group, all drivers. They have spent years stopping and fining discretion with a clear collection spirit"
