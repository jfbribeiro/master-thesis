The north of the country is fertile in these services. Thank you to those responsible and those who look after these service areas for motorhomes."

We found this beautiful place by chance and stayed for 3 days. From here you can get to Sintra and Lisbon very quickly and easily by Uber, which is really a rarity for a parking space for campers in this region. The site is beautifully laid out, every pitch has electricity, there are clean sanitary facilities and toilets and disposing of gray water is no problem. A small oasis just outside Lisbon and Sintra."
